Action timer are value 0 - 0xffff. 0xffff - means unit can act.

There are 6 types of battle formation.
0,5 - normal
1,3 - player advantage
2,4 - enemy advantage

Start value of action timer for normal battle calculated as "[random 0-0xffff] + 0xe0000 - max_random".
Max random are maximum random value among all units.
Start value of action timer for player advantage battle are 0xfffe for player and "[random 0-0xffff] / 8" for enemy.
Start value of action timer for enemy advantage battle are 0x0 for player and "[random 0-0xffff] + 0xf000" for enemy.
There is some additional check (I think this is for sephiroth battle) that set player action timer to 0xfffe and set enemy timer to 0.

Action timer increase by unit speed aproximately 30 times per second.

Unit speed calculated as "battle_speed * dexterity / party_dexterity". This uses final dexterity with all bonuses.
Party dexterity calculated as sum of dexterity from all party units divided by number of party members plus 0x32. Real formula looks like this "((total_dexterity - 1 + number_of_party) / number_of_party + 0x32)"
Battle speed calculated as "0x8000 / (config_battle_speed * 0x3c0 / 0x100 + 0x78)"
It's speed for slow status. It is multiplied by 2 for normal and by 4 for haste.

Final formula cooks like this:
(0x8000 / (config_battle_speed * 0x3c0 / 0x100 + 0x78)) * [0-slow|2-normal|4-haste] * dexterity_with_bonuses / (((dexterity_1 + dexterity_2 + dexterity_3 - 1 + number_of_party) / number_of_party + 32))
