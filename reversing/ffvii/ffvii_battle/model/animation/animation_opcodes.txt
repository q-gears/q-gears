0xab
0xac
0xad - set_effect                       - AD[joint XX][distance XXXX][start XX][end XX] Attach effect (machinegun) to joint 07 with given distanse from this joint which starts at 01 and ends at 0x0a. Always machingun fire. If end 0x80 byte is set then we do not add shell effect.

0xb6 - pause_camera_finish_animation    - B6[animation XX] pause camera scripts and then continue to play animation given animation from frame that already set. Used to smoothly finish idle animation before start of anything else. Camera paused because we want camera be sync with start of action (this is just finish animation that was already started).
0xb7
0xb8
0xb9 - set_camera                       - B9[camera_script_id XX] set camera script id to use.

0xc3
0xc4
0xc5 - set_unit_fade_wait               - C5 set value from 0x800f8374 (unit fade time) as wait time for action script.
0xc6 - set_unit_fade_time               - C6[wait XX] set value to 0x800f8374 (unit fade time) for futher use.
0xc7
0xc8
0xc9 - jump_label                       - C9 do nothing just go to next opcode. Used as marker when jump up.
0xca - jump_if_not_loaded               - CA jump to first meet C9 at start of this script if something loading in background.

0xd0 - D0[4C04][01] jump to enemy
0xd1 - move_to_target                   - D1[distance XXXX][XXXX][steps XX] move to enemy using function 0x800cf5bc by number of steps. Stop distance is distance to target collision radius.

0xe5 - return_direction                 - E5 set initial (idle) direction for current unit acording to situation.
0xe6
0xe7
0xe8 - load_additional_effect           - E8 start load effect requested during attack (attack type id and attack id are used to determinate what effect to load).
0xe9
0xea - show_action_name                 - EA show action name.
0xeb
0xec - execute_additional_effect        - EC if effect not loaded we will call this opcode until it does. For magic, summon, limit, enemy skill and enemy attack we execute loaded effect. All effects are hardcoded so they can do whatever they want (play sounds, display damage, request hurt for target and so on).
0xed
0xee - return_to_idle                   - EE reset to idle. Script pointer to 0.

0xf4 - set_wait                         - F4[wait XX] set frames to wait.
0xf5
0xf6 - play_die_if_dead                 - F6 play die effect (depends on die type) if unit is dead. Used in enemy hurt actions.
0xf7 - execute_attack                   - F7[wait XX] after wait time ends execute hurt action, effect, sound. This will display damage and barriers effect.
