0x800cd82c (stop_camera)
            stop camera scripts and finish.

0x800d061c (sound)
            wait given number of frames and plays sound using attacker settings.

0x800d3af0 (machinegun splash) used as effect of shell take off and as effect that shell drop on ground.
            create particle quad that changing texture every of 8 frames. Position not changed. Uses tha same texture as 0x800d3bf0.

0x800d3bf0 (foot_dust part) - effect of dust (one dust cloud)
            create particle quad that scale from 1 to 2 by 8 frames, changing texture every frame. Position not changed.

0x800d3d88 (foot_dust) - effect of dust (total).
            create 4 effects 0x800d3bf0 (one dust cloud) in position of joints 0xb,0xc,0xb,0xc. One effect by frame.

0x800d7368 (machinegun shell)
            load 3d data for shell effect and move it by setted direction every frame. When position reach ground we create effect 0x800d3af0 at this place and set it to fall down again (with random direction). When it falls down again we create effect 0x800d3af0 at this place and stop this effect.

0x800d751c (machinegun fire&light light)
            create particle quad for 1 frame that rotates by Y randomly.

0x800d7724 (machinegun fire&light)
            load 3d data for fire effect for 1 frame and create effect for 0x800d751c.

0x800d7888 (machinegun) - effect of machinegun fire (total).
            every second frame create effect 0x800d7724 and, if 0x80 bit in end frame data setted, create effect 0x800d7368 with random direction of movement and effect 0x800d3af0.
