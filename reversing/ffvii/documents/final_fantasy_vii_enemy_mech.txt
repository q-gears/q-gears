=============================================================================

v1.00 : 19/08/04 : Original Release
v1.02 : 13/09/04 : Fixed a few errors in various enemies
                     (thanks to SineNomine for pointing some of them out)
                   Added extra section detailing Item Drop and Steal rates
v1.05 : 26/04/05 : Fixed a few errors in certain counter scripts

                   Large updates to all abilities, adding Hit Rate and
                     Formula Type data.  The formulas to interpret these
                     properly - as well as needed corrections and changes to
                     certain terms and old data - will be in a future Battle
                     Mechanics update
v1.06 : 14/07/05 : Updated a few terms and rewrote all status chances to make
                     them clearer.  Also finished research on the unknown
                     elemental resistances, and updated accordingly
v1.10 : 29/06/09 : Added Run Difficulty to all encounters.  A number of
                     slight inaccuracies and AI errors were found and
                     corrected too
                   Synched with sister guides
v1.11 : 31/07/09 : Enemy Data underwent a full reverification, and a good
                     30+ errors were found and fixed
                   Chocobo Ratings were added
                   World Map Encounter details were revised

COMPONENT GUIDES
=============================================================================

The FF7 Game Mechanics Guides are split into three files.  This guide, the
third in the series, will detail the stats, attacks and formations of the
enemies you meet.  The other two are:

  The FF7 Battle Mechanics:
    Covers the battle mechanics as a whole, and is required reading for
  understanding this current guide.

  The FF7 Party Mechanics:
    Covers the various battle data relating to the party, notably data
  regarding spell stats, materia use, and limit breaks.


The FF7 Battle Mechanics is the main one to start with, since it will define
many terms that will be used in both Party and Enemy Mechanics.

Note that this guide is based on the PC version.  While most alleged
gameplay differences between the PC and PSX versions have been proven false,
more may exist.

1. FOREWORD
=============================================================================

Before we delve into the heart of the enemy mechanics, there are various
things that must be said, especially regarding the accuracy and layout of
this guide.

First off, while this is not specifically a technical document, it *does*
strive to be accurate in the large majority of cases.  Many parts of the
document are written to be accurate with the game code itself.  However,
other parts have been translated into data that are not precisely what the
game does, but are easier to understand: for example, the AI routines of
each enemy have been simplified where possible for this guide.  Previous
versions of this document also listed what untargetable enemies existed;
this has since been removed since it really adds nothing to the guide and
was incomplete, in any case.

Also, many enemies share the same attacks.  No indication of which attacks
are shared will be given in this guide - there are many attacks which have
exactly the same name and effect but may have different attack IDs.  This is
also sometimes the case when the same enemy has multiple attacks with the
same name and effect.  In this case, the only difference is when it is used
via the AI script and the animation attached to it.  In this case, I will
sometimes indicate which version within the AI script.  In general though,
this guide will condense them all into one attack and attempt to explain when
it is used.  (An example of this is Reno's Pyramid attack, of which he has
three different versions for each of the three Pyramids he can call into
being)

The purpose of this guide is to remain true to the enemy stats listed in
FF7's data files.  As such, this will generally have priority.  However, I
am not immune to making mistakes, and with the sheer amount of information
being conveyed, some are bound to turn up from time to time.

I was heading for accuracy.  At this present time, I believe this guide to be
more accurate in most things than many other monster lists already published,
and in this respect, I have succeeded in my goal.  However, total accuracy is
still elusive.  As such, if you wish to use this guide, please take its
faults into account.


NOTE (26/06/2009): While quite extensive, there are still some things left
missing.  Of particular interest are certain unknown variables in the AI
scripts.  If you see a variable listed like [0000] or [2040], please do not
worry overmuch about it; I know they exist, and am fairly sure that most
are merely technical changes that do not affect how a battle plays out.

Many things have been corrected as time has passed, but I still cannot be
sure that none do not remain.  It's 1000+ KB of text.  All I can say is that
I've tried my best, and I hope you find use from it.



=============================================================================
2. BASIC MECHANICS
=============================================================================

This short section is devoted to covering important formulas and procedures
necessary to understand certain parts of this guide, that are complicated
enough to require more than a few paragraphs, but unique enough to not fit
anywhere else.



--------------
2.1 Item Rates
--------------
Each enemy in the game can carry up to four different items, divided up
between items that you can win from them and items you can steal from them.
From a single enemy, it is only possible to earn one of these items.  The
item you get depends on what you use (either stealing or simply killing them)
and random chance.

Each item - whether it be Won or Stolen - has an Item Chance, which is a
unique number that determines how often it drops.  The following two sections
detail how this number becomes an actual probability of dropping or being
stolen.


2.1.1 Winning Items
----- -------------
You have a chance at winning an item if an enemy is killed and you finish the
battle successfully.  In addition, the enemy cannot have been stolen from and
must not have been killed by Remove.  Finally, the battle must finish with
the default ending screen that awards EXP/AP/Gil/Items.  Battle Square
battles do not do this, and multi-part battles only count the final battle in
the series.  (Example: The Hundred Gunner and Heli Gunner battle only awards
the Heli Gunner part of the battle)

An enemy that is able to award items upon winning will have a list of said
items, each with their own chance of being dropped.  For example, a Razor
Weed has the following list:

          Win: [ 8] Tranquilizer, [ 8] Hi-Potion, [ 8] Loco Weed


Both the chance of each item and the order are important.  When an item is
to be dropped, each item in the list is looked at in turn.  The item being
looked at will be awarded if the following occurs:

    If Rnd(0..63) <= Chance of Item, then Current Item is won!


This means that you have (Chance + 1)/64 that the current item being looked
at will be dropped.  This is done in order, however, so with the example item
list above, it would be done like this:

      9/64 Chance: Win the Tranquilizer
     55/64 Chance: Move to next item...
            9/64 Chance: Win the Hi-Potion
           55/64 Chance: Move to next item...
                  9/64 Chance: Win the Loco Weed
                 55/64 Chance: No item is dropped

For this example, this means you have the following chances of each item:

        Tranquilizer:          9/64 chance, 14.06%
        Hi-Potion:         495/4096 chance, 12.08%
        Loco Weed:     27225/262144 chance, 10.39%
        Nothing:      166375/262144 chance, 63.47%


As you can see, even though they each had the same individual chance, the
earlier items in the list are more likely to drop than the later items.

This follows for any enemy that can drop an item; the chance per item is
always (Chance+1)/64, meaning that a Chance of 63 is a 100% drop rate.



2.1.2 Stealing Items
----- --------------
You may steal an item from an enemy whenever it is carrying one or more items
classed as being stealable.  If you successfully steal an item, then that
enemy will have no more items to either drop upon defeat or to be stolen.
(You will, of course, still be able to Morph them....)

The chance of stealing an item is similar to the chance of an item being
dropped, with a single difference: your Level and the target's Level are
combined to form a modifier that adjusts the Chance of all items before they
are tested against.

The modifier is calculated like so:

           Lvl Diff = 40 + Attacker's Level - Target's Level
           StealMod = [512 * Lvl Diff / 100]


The Modifier is then applied to each Item Chance via the following formula:

           New Chance = [Item Chance * StealMod / 256]


Steal chances are exactly equal to Item Drop chances when StealMod is equal
to 256; this occurs when you are 10 levels higher than your target.  We can
also see that Steal chances are *doubled* when StealMod is equal to 512; this
occurs when you are *60* levels higher than your target.

The same test used for Item Drops is used for Stealing; each item in the
Steal list is looked at in order, with the following test applied:

    If Rnd(0..63) <= Chance of Item, then Current Item is stolen!


To see how this all works, let's take a look at an example.  A popular one
is the Bagrisk, who is L19 and has the following Steal List:

          Steal: [32] Soft, [32] Soft, [ 8] Vagyrisk Claw


If the person stealing from the Bagrisk is L29, then the chances are
identical to the basic Item Drop chances; 33/64 chance of the first Soft,
33/64 chance of the second Soft (if the first Soft fails) and then 9/64
chance of the Vagyrisk Claw if both Softs fail to be stolen.  If we do the
calculations, this leads to a 76.54% chance of a Soft, 3.30% chance of a
Vagyrisk Claw and 20.16% chance of nothing.

If the person stealing from the Bagrisk is L79, then the individual numbers
are doubled.  This means that the first Soft will be stolen if Rnd(0..63) is
less or equal to 64... which it always will be.  This means we have a 100%
chance of stealing a Soft... but it also means we have a 0% chance of
stealing the Vagyrisk Claw.

In fact, the chances of stealing a Vagyrisk Claw are finally closed off at
L78.  Let's go over this particular example in detail.

At L78, we get:

           Lvl Diff = 40 + Attacker's Level - Target's Level
                    = 40 + 78 - 19
                    = 99
           StealMod = [512 * Lvl Diff / 100]
                    = [512 * 99 / 100]
                    = [506.88]
                    = 506

Each Item Chance will thus be multiplied by 506/256 and then rounded down.
The chance for each Soft is 32, which becomes:

                     [32 * 506 / 256] = [63.25] = 63


The Item Chance for the Vagyrisk Claw (though it doesn't matter), becomes:

                      [8 * 506 / 256] = [15.8125] = 15


Finally, we get to test each item.  We will steal the first Soft if
Rnd(0..63) is less or equal to 63, which it *always* will be.  We therefore
have a 100% chance of stealing the first Soft, and a 0% chance of getting
anything after it in the list.


There is one final modifier in stealing: the Sneak Glove.  If the character
stealing has a Sneak Glove equipped, then StealMod will be set to 512
*MINIMUM*.  This means that you will, at a very minimum, be set to 60 levels
greater than your target with regards to stealing.  Note that the Sneak Glove
will never *lower* your chance of stealing; if you are more than 60 levels
over your target already, it will have no effect.  Also note that because it
alters StealMod, it is able to boost your chances even higher than being L99
would against enemies at L40 or higher.

As you can probably guess from the examples we've already looked at, wearing
a Sneak Glove will reduce your chances of stealing a Vagyrisk Claw to 0.  And
if you think being really low level helps all that much for Vagyrisk Claw
stealing... well, the best individual chance is at L11, where you have a
54.86% chance of stealing a Soft, 4.23% chance of stealing a Vagyrisk Claw
and a 40.91% chance of failing.  The calculations required to get these
figures are left as an exercise for the reader.



=============================================================================
3. RANDOM ENCOUNTERS
=============================================================================

--------------------
3.1 Encounter Basics
--------------------
FF7 is divided into areas.  A single screen in a dungeon or town is called
a Field Map area, and when you change Field Maps, you very often change the
rate you will encounter enemies.

On the World Map, however, the division of areas is through defined borders.
For instance, there is a mountain range and river that seperates Corel Area
from both North Corel Area and Gold Saucer Area.  You can see which area you
are currently in by opening up the menu and looking at the bottom right of
the screen.

Each unique area can support up to 6 Normal battles and 4 Special Formation
battles.  In addition, World Map areas can support a further 4 Chocobo
battles.



First, we will look at how the game decides *when* a random encounter should
occur.  The Field Maps and World Map have slightly different ways of deciding
this, so we shall look at them in turn.


Field Maps
==========
While moving, a variable called the Field Danger Counter is incremented every
so often.  The higher the Danger Counter, the more likely you are to enter a
random battle.  Some areas increase the Danger Counter at a larger rate than
others.  The difference between more and less dangerous areas is marked by a
stat known as the area's Encounter Value.

High Encounter Values are safer than normal, and you can usually run quite a
distance without getting into a random battle.  Low Encounter Values are more
dangerous, and the random encounters are more frequent.

The Danger Counter is incremented every time a battle check occurs, which
happens roughly three times per second when moving.

Walking increases the Danger Counter by [1024 / Encounter Value] per battle
check.  Running increases the Danger Counter by [4096 / Encounter Value]
per battle check.  Note that running is four times faster than walking, so
the distance covered ends up about the same, with the exception of rounding.
However, while running, the number of times the battle check is called will
be lower over the same distance, so you may find you have *less* encounters.

You will encounter a random battle if, during a battle check, Rnd(0..255) is
less than [Danger Counter * Enemy Lure Value / 256].  Note that the Enemy
Lure Value is a fraction between 2/16ths to 32/16ths, but is only altered
through the presence of Enemy Lure and Enemy Away Materia on your party.
The default value when no such Materia is equipped is 16/16ths or 100%.

Note that the Field Danger Counter is reset after a *random* battle only,
and carries over from screen to screen.


World Map
=========
The World Map has its own Danger Counter.  In this case, however, the
counter is incremented by [Enemy Lure Value * 16384 / Encounter Value] per
battle check.  Another thing to note is that the Enemy Lure Value is
doubled if it is greater than 16/16ths, making enemy luring count for *twice*
as much as it usually does.  The average value per battle check tends to be
512, since Enemy Lure Value is usually 16/16ths and Grass areas tend to have
an Encounter Value of 32.

Battle checks occur less often on the World Map, averaging about one per
second while moving.  However, the higher increase of the Danger Counter
makes up for this.

Again, you will enter a random battle if, during a battle check, Rnd(0..255)
is less than [Danger Counter / 256].

Unlike the Field Danger Counter, the Danger Counter for the World Map is
reset whenever you leave or enter the World Map.  This includes entering any
town or dungeon or submerging while in the Sub.  While it does not include
switching to the Highwind's cockpit from the World Map, it *DOES* include
switching to the World Map from the Highwind's cockpit.



As soon as the chance succeeds and a random battle is going to occur, the
following things are considered in order:
   Unique/Chocobo Battles
   Pre-emptive Chance
   Special Formations
   Normal Battles


Unique/Chocobo Battles
======================
On the World Map, there are a few unique checks that must be made.  The
very first is the Mystery Ninja check.  If you are in a forest or jungle and
a random battle occurs, there is a chance you will face the Mystery Ninja
instead... providing you haven't recruited Yuffie yet.  See the Mystery Ninja
section for details.

Otherwise, the other check that is done is for Chocobos.  If you are on a
chocobo track area and have a Chocobo Lure Materia equipped, then there is
the possibility you will get a Chocobo battle instead.  The check done is
as follows:

     Chance = [Rnd(0..255) * 4096 / Chocobo Lure Rating]
     If (Chance < Chocobo Battle Chance #1) Then
        Do Chocobo Battle #1!
        Stop Check Here
     Chance = Chance - Chocobo Battle Chance #1
     If (Chance < Chocobo Battle Chance #2) Then
        Do Chocobo Battle #2!
        Stop Check Here
     Chance = Chance - Chocobo Battle Chance #2
     If (Chance < Chocobo Battle Chance #3) Then
        Do Chocobo Battle #3!
        Stop Check Here
     Chance = Chance - Chocobo Battle Chance #3
     If (Chance < Chocobo Battle Chance #4) Then
        Do Chocobo Battle #4!
        Stop Check Here


The Chocobo Battle Chance for each of the four possible battles comes from
the Battle ID for that Chocobo ID and the standard 'chance' to get that
battle.  The full number is equal to 'Chance * 1024 + Battle ID'.  However,
because the Battle ID is included in the numerical check, it is required to
list the entire number when giving the chances to get a Chocobo Battle.

Please note that a standard L1 Chocobo Lure gives you a Chocobo Lure Rating
of 8.  A L2 Lure grants a Rating of 12, and a L3 or L4 Chocobo Lure grants
a final Rating of 16.  While Chocobo Lures do stack, the maximum Rating you
can get is 32.

A Chocobo Lure Rating of 8 would give you a Chance value of between 0 and
130560, which, essentially, gives you a 75% chance of a Chocobo battle in
Kalm, 50% chance in Junon and 25% elsewhere.

A Chocobo Lure Rating of 16 would give you a Chance of between 0 and 65280,
which is roughly 100% in Kalm and Junon and 50% elsewhere.

Finally, a Chocobo Lure Rating of 32 would give you a Chance between 0 and
32640, which is a 100% chance of a Chocobo fight whichever tracks you may be
at.

Please note that the level of the Chocobo does not determine how good the
Chocobo is.  Chocobo ratings are determined by exactly *which* encounter
you get.


Pre-emptive Chance
==================
Pre-emptive chance is worked out next.  You have a base chance of 16/256 of
getting a Pre-emptive battle.  A mastered Pre-emptive Materia will boost this
up to 64/256.  The maximum this value can go to is 85/256, which is roughly a
1/3rd chance.  Rnd(0..255) is rolled for this: if the number is lower than
your Pre-emptive chance, then you are rewarded with Pre-emptive status when
the battle begins... assuming the battle allows a Pre-emptive attack.


For the remaining battle types, we will focus on how the Field Map deals
with them.  The World Map has slightly different rules, and the differences
between them will be looked at at the end of this section.

Special Formation Battles
=========================
If the area has any Special Formation battles, you have a chance of getting
them first (after Mystery Ninja and Chocobo battles, of course).  These
almost always have you at a disadvantage.  However, a 5-star Pre-emptive
Materia will help protect you against these battles by halving the chances of
the disadvantageous ones.  We will call this an Ambush Alert bonus.

Note that FF7 has some special quirks about detecting whether you have a
5-star Pre-emptive Materia equipped or not.  It's important to note that
there are two different types of checks that are used to detect a 5-star
Materia: a single character check and a global check.

The single character check is made whenever you change Materia or Equipment
on a character.  None of the other characters are looked at: only the
character you're changing Materia on now counts.  If that character does
*NOT* have a 5-star Pre-emptive Materia equipped, then the game will decide
you do not have one and remove the Ambush Alert bonus.  It doesn't matter if
another character does have a 5-star Materia.

The global check is primarily used when you enter the Menu screen from the
world map or field screen, or when you exit the PHS screen.  The primary
problem here is that the way it does the check is to run the single character
check on each character in your party in turn, starting from the top.

What this means is that only the *last* character (the bottommost) in your
party really counts for whether they have a 5-star Pre-emptive Materia or
not.  As such, if you want to get the most out of the Ambush Alert bonus, you
should place the 5-star Pre-emptive Materia on your last character.


Now that the game has ascertained whether you get the Ambush Alert bonus or
not, the game will go through all four possible Special Formation battles for
the area, in the following order:

Back Attack #1 and #2:
  The first two Special Formations are meant for Back Attacks, where you
  begin facing away from the enemy with your formation reversed (back row
  becomes front row and vice versa) and the enemies invariably get the first
  attack.  You cannot get a Pre-emptive attack for these battles.  However,
  Ambush Alert will reduce the chance of meeting Back Attacks by half.  Note
  that while you are shown as facing away from the enemy, you are not
  *really* doing so: you do not take the usual double damage from being hit
  from behind.  The only real disadvantage is having your formation reversed.
  Please also note that this means that those tricks to automatically get you
  to face forward (like attempting to run for a split second to turn your
  party around) do nothing.

Side Attack: 
  This Special Formation is reserved for when you surround a single enemy
  group.  Ambush Alert will *not* reduce the chances of getting this
  advantageous battle.  Pre-emptive chance is not removed by getting a Side
  Attack, but it either has no effect or a different effect from normal; your
  entire party begins a Side Attack with all their time bars filled, while
  the enemies have theirs delayed significantly.

Ambush:
  The final possible battle is an attack from both sides for the enemy, where
  you are surrounded by two enemy groups.  Ambush Alert reduces the chance
  of Ambushes by half.  While Pre-emptive chance is not removed by getting
  this battle, it either has no effect or a different effect from normal;
  you begin an ambush with your time bars fully depleted, while your enemies
  gain a slight increase to their own time bar values.


All Special Formation Battles have a chance out of 64 of occurring.  A single
random number - Rnd(0..63) - is rolled to determine both if you will get a
Special Formation battle *and* which one you get if you do.  The chance of
not getting a Special Formation battle is equal to 64/64 minus the sum of the
probabilities of all available Special Formation battles (this includes the
probability halving for Back Attacks and Ambushes that Ambush Alert grants).

Rarely, a Back Attack battle will be placed in the Ambush slot, or an Ambush
battle will be placed in the Back Attack slots.  Where this occurs, I will
mark the battles as "BAtt (Ambush) #1" or "Amb. (Back Attack)".  Even rarer,
a Special Battle may be placed in the Normal slots below.  For this, I will
use "Normal (Side) #1" or similar.


Normal Battles
==============
If neither a Special Formation nor a Chocobo Battle has been able to occur,
then the normal battles are finally checked.  This is a simple chance out
of 64 for each battle allowed, with a single Rnd(0..63) deciding which of the
battles is chosen.

There is one exception however: if you get the *exact* same battle formation
as you did last time, then the game will reroll *once* for a new Normal
Battle.  If you still get the same battle, then no further rerolls are done.
However, this does mean that you are less likely (in general) to get the same
battle than you are to get a new battle.

Note that Special Formation battles never share the same IDs of Normal
Battles, so only Normal Battles will count for rerolls.


BUG: Due to an error with regards to signed numbers, any Normal Battle chance
that is 32/64 or greater will actually be treated as a negative number:
Chance - 64.  How FF7 reacts to this depends, but for the most part, if it
was the first encounter in the list, it will cause it to have a 100% chance
of being selected, providing no Special Battle was encountered.

Note that World Map encounters do not suffer from this bug, and all chances
listed in this document already take this bug into account: if you see a
battle with 32/64 chance or greater, then it is because it's a group of
battles pointing to the same encounter.  The bugged encounters have already
been modified to show 64/64 instead.


World Map Differences
=====================
The way encounters are decided on the World Map are slightly different,
despite being based around the same data system.  The key differences are
as follows:


  Special Formation Battles
  -------------------------
Instead of a single random value being used for all four types of Special
Formations, they are checked individually in a particularly obtuse way.

The two Back Attack slots are checked first, using a single Rnd(0..255).
The usual chances out of 64 are multiplied by either 2 if you have Ambush
Alert, or 4 if you don't.  However, due to the way the battles are compared,
the first Back Attack will have a 1/256 greater chance of being picked
overall.  For example, if the Back Attack battle had a 4/64 chance
originally, the true chance would instead be 17/256 (or 9/256 under Ambush
Alert).  The 2nd Back Attack battle (if it exists) is not affected by this
bug.

If you don't get a Back Attack, then Side Attack is checked next, and a new
Rnd(0..255) is used for it.  And once again, the usual chance out of 64 is
multiplied by 64, and the same bug gives a 1/256 greater chance of the Side
Attack happening.

If you fail to get either a Back or Side Attack, then Ambush is checked last.
Again, it has a new Rnd(0..255) used, and the chance out of 64 is multiplied
by either 2 (if Ambush Alert) or 4 (if not under Ambush Alert).  The same
1/256 greater chance is also applied due to the bug in comparing the chances.

This means that the chance of not getting a Special Formation on the World
Map is not the sum of the chances subtracted from 64, but instead the three
chances of not getting a Back Attack, not getting a Side Attack and not
getting an Ambush multiplied together.  On top of that, Side Attacks and
Ambushes hinge on having failed to get any previous Special Formation that
exists in the current World Map area, which reduce the chances of seeing them
further.


  Normal Battles
  --------------
Like the Special Formations, a single Rnd(0..255) is used with the chances
out of 64 multiplied by 4.  The same bug described previously exists with the
Normal Battles on the World Map too, so the first battle in each list has a
1/256 greater chance than indicated, whilst the *last* battle in each list
has a 1/256 *lesser* chance than indicated.  So if an area had two battles
marked 32/64 each, then the first battle would instead have a 129/256 chance
of being chosen, whilst the second (and last) battle would have a 127/256
chance of being chosen.

Note that there is still a reroll if a Normal Battle is chosen that matches
the same battle that was encountered last time, which further complicates
the chances of a battle being picked.


In the encounter table in the next section, all World Map encounters will be
displayed with their standard chance out of 64, but please be aware of the
various ways the chances are manipulated due to the mentioned bugs and
checked parameters.



------------------
3.2 Encounter List
------------------
In this section, we will list all random encounters in the game, sorting them
by location.  The first subsection will deal with World Map encounters, while
the second subsection will deal with Field Map encounters.  The final
subsection will deal with certain uniquely random encounters that do not use
the previously defined encounter system.

A few things about how encounters are listed.  First, I only list the enemies
that can be targeted and are visible at the start of battle.  A number of
enemies have hidden 'forms' or 'companions' that they call on as the battle
progresses.  In all cases, these have been detailed in the Enemy Data
section.  I will not, for example, expressely state that Grangalan can
summon a Grangalan Jr. here, or that a Grosspanzer comprises of
Grosspanzer*Big, Grosspanzer*Mobile and two Grosspanzer*Smalls.

Also, anytime two different chances point to the same battle, I have combined
them into a single chance.  This also means that if there are two battles
that I have listed with the *same* apparent formation, then they are
*DIFFERENT* battles.  This is important to note in regards to the 'reroll'
clause that reduces the chance of getting the same battle twice in a row.

Thirdly, every encounter has its unique Run Difficulty.  The large majority
of encounters have a Run Difficulty of 1 - these are very easy to escape.
Back Attacks and encounters with certain enemies or in certain locations have
been designed to have an increased Run Difficulty though, so for every
encounter that has a Run Difficulty higher than 1, it will be listed in the
encounter itself.  The higher the Run Difficulty, the longer it takes for
your escape to be successful.

And finally, each battle is listed by which 'Row' an enemy is in.  A Row is a
measure of Range; enemies in higher Rows are considered to be behind enemies
in lower Rows.  This is where the 'Back Row' definition for enemies comes
from; an enemy is considered to be in the Back Row until *all* enemies in
the rows in front of it have been defeated or otherwise dealt with.  For
instance, the first battle in Midgar Area - Grass has three Kalm Fangs,
with Kalm Fang B in Row 2 and Kalm Fang C in Row 3.  Both of these are
behind Kalm Fang A in Row 1.  So, Kalm Fang B is in the Back Row until
Kalm Fang A has been killed... but Kalm Fang C is in the Back Row until both
Kalm Fang A *and* B have been dispatched.  Certain rare enemies can change
'rows' via their AI script; there, it is called the Range variable.

Note on rows/range: RowFl means Row 'Flying', which is another way of saying
Row 16.  Any enemy at Row 16 or above can no longer be hit by short range
abilities.  This is known as "Can't Reach" - the message that appears when
you try to hit such a target.  Very few enemies start in Row 16, but several
can change their Range to 16.  Further information can be found in the
appropriate enemy descriptions in the Enemy Data section.


3.2.1 World Map Encounters
----- --------------------
The list of World Map Encounters is divided first by area and then terrain -
each area can have up to four different terrain possibilities, which can have
their own individual encounter chances.  Areas are listed in story order.

3.2.2 Field Map Encounters
----- --------------------
In this section, we will deal with the random encounters for every field map
in the game.  Note that I have left out any field maps that do not have
random encounters.  This also includes some seemingly random encounters that
are *not* random - they will be dealt with in the final subsection.

I have also placed section headings which co-incide with the Enemy Data
sections I use later in this guide.  As always, everything is listed in
rough story order.  I have done my best to be descriptive with regards to
which map has which encounters, but please forgive me if it's sometimes
a little hard to understand.

In any case, on with the list.

3.2.3 Unique Random Encounters
----- ------------------------
There are a few areas in the game where encounters are random, but are
event-driven and do not use the standard encounter system.  The first main
one is Battle Square, but that has been dealt with already in the individual
Battle Square sections within the Enemy Listing.

The other two areas that we will touch on are the Shinra HQ Elevator and the
final descent in the Northern Crater.


  Shinra HQ Elevator
  ==================
When infiltrating Shinra HQ, one of the optional routes you can take is the
central elevator up to the 59th floor.  As you do so, however, the elevator
goes haywire and you are forced to stop at random floors of the building,
which frequently prompt a battle.  The battle you encounter is tied to the
floor you stop on.

You begin the trip starting on Floor 6.  Everytime Cloud presses the button
to stop the elevator, you will end up a random number of floors higher than
your last stop with the following chances of each:

                      2/16 chance:  7 Floors higher
                      2/16 chance:  8 Floors higher
                      2/16 chance:  9 Floors higher
                      2/16 chance: 10 Floors higher
                      2/16 chance: 11 Floors higher
                      2/16 chance: 12 Floors higher
                      2/16 chance: 13 Floors higher
                      1/16 chance: 14 Floors higher
                      1/16 chance: 15 Floors higher


This means that your first stop will be between Floors 13 and 21 inclusive.
The doors will open and you will face the battle for that floor.  Once the
battle is over, you are able to progress another 7 to 15 floors, all until
the elevator reaches Floor 59, ending this journey.  Obviously, the elevator
will not go higher than this floor and will stop as soon as it passes it.

As stated previously, the encounter you get depends on the floor the elevator
stops at.  However, not all the floors trigger a battle.  Certain floors,
instead, reveal an unfortunate Shinra employee who simply lets you go on your
way.  Meeting Hito (the name of this employee in the data files) is simply
an amusing little event that can happen randomly and can even happen multiple
times if you hit the right floors.

With that aside, we'll list the floors and their appropriate encounters.

  Final Descent
  =============
After passing the point of no return in the Northern Crater, you descend
down a series of hovering platforms towards the battle with Jenova*SYNTHESIS.

Every time you hop to a new platform, you have a 76/256 (29.69%) chance of
being attacked.  If you are attacked, the enemy will be one of the following:

                 1x Allemagne:        26/256 (10.2%) chance
                 1x Iron Man:        128/256 (50.0%) chance
                 1x Dragon Zombie:   102/256 (39.8%) chance


These battles occur only when you jump to a new platform.  There are 5 jumps
on the first screen and 8 jumps on the second screen.

    Elm:
    Attr:
    Notes: 


Each of these fields contain the following data:
  Name         - The name of the enemy
  Lvl          - The enemy's Level
  HP           - The Max HP the enemy has

  Win          - The item(s) that are sometimes earned when the enemy is
                   killed, and the chance class they will drop (63 max)
                 If, when the item is checked, Rnd(0..63) is less or equal
                   to the chance class, then the item will drop
                 Items listed first are more likely to be dropped than
                   subsequent items
  Steal        - The item(s) that can be stolen from the enemy, and the
                   chance class you can steal it (63 max)
                 Items listed first are more likely to be stolen than
                   subsequent items
  Morph        - The item that the enemy can be morphed into

  NOTE: A few rare enemies have weaknesses and resistances to particular
        Status Attributes.  If this is the case, they will react to that
        Status as if it were an Element.  This is different from an Immunity
        to that Status - for example, a physical attack that inflicts
        Confusion as well will do double damage to a Corvette, who are weak
        to 'Confusion' Status Abilities.


  Att          - The enemy's Attack stat

    Each attack is listed seperately.

    Name       - The name of the attack.  If the attack name is in brackets
                   (like <Tonfa>), then this is what FF7 calls it, but when
                   the attack is used, no name will show up.  You can see
                   hidden attack names if they are Manipulatable
    Attack Type- See section 1.2.2 in the FF7 Battle Mechanics
    Formula    - See section 1.2.3 in the FF7 Battle Mechanics
    Pwr        - The Power of the attack.  Closely linked with the Formula of
                   the ability.  Note that for Physical and Magical Formula
                   attacks, this will be expressed as a fraction of Base -
                   however, the true Power value would be the fraction
                   multiplied by 16.  For example, 1x Base indicates a Power
                   of 16 when used in the Physical and Magical Formulas,
                   while 1/4x Base would be a Power of 4.  It has been done
                   this way simply to make it easier to see how it affects
                   damage, and how well attacks compare to each other.
                 If the attack uses the Physical, Magical, Cure, Item or
                   Fixed formulas, then the actual strength of the attack
                   (using the enemy's base) will be displayed in brackets
                   after the formula.  For example, MP's Tonfa attack has a
                   base damage of 9, after using the formula given for it
    PAt%       - The basic chance to hit the ability has.  100 is average,
    MAt%           while 255 is the max.  MAt% is used instead for abilities
    Auto Hit       that use the hit formula for magic abilities, and Auto Hit
                   is displayed for anything that uses neither the PAt% or
                   MAt% methods to hit.  The algorithms and formulas that use
                   these values can be found in the Battle Mechanics guide
    Cost       - How much MP the attack costs the enemy.  If an enemy does
                   not have the MP the attack requires, it can no longer use
                   this attack
    Tar        - The target(s) of the attack.  See section 1.2.4 in the FF7
                   Battle Mechanics for details.  In the case of attacks that
                   can switch between 1 Tar and All Tar, the first listed
                   will be the default the monster uses
    Elm        - Element of the attack.  All attacks that cause damage have
                   an element.  See section 1.2 in the FF7 Battle Mechanics
                   for an explaination about elements, including the hidden
                   physical ones
    Attr       - Any special effects the attack has in addition to the Attack
                   Type.  Whether the attack is Manipulatable or not is also
                   shown here.  In addition, Status Changes and their
                   respective chance classes to succeed also go here
    Notes      - Any special details about the attack that isn't covered in
                   any of the previous fields


  Animations:
    These are essentially 'Attacks' that have no effect and are used by FF7
    to change the animation of the enemy.  This is also why an enemy will
    often have many versions of the same attack; the difference is not in
    the stats, but in the animation they use.



A Note about Stats
------------------
  Each of the main stats (Att, Def, Df%, MAt, MDf, Dex and Lck) are already
the derived versions of the stat.  For example, an enemy's Df% will not get
any bonus from their Dex - for monsters, it's considered the final stat.
However, Dex is still used to help increase the enemy's chance to hit, for
example.  Enemies also do not have a MD% stat, a weakness that is useful to
exploit.

  Another note about Dex: with regards to how fast an enemy's Time Bar fills,
you should consider their Dex value to be *50 points lower* than their actual
value is when you compare to members of Cloud's party.  That means that an
Unknown 2 - with a listed value of 150 Dex - is no faster than a party member
with 100 Dex, while a 1st Ray with a Dex of 40 will never be able to move
faster than any of your party members.

  The reason for this is that party members get a 50 point bonus to their Dex
for calculating the rate their Time Bar fills up at, while enemies do not get
this same bonus.  As such, don't be fooled by the seemingly high Dex values
of many of the enemies.

4.2 AI Data
-----------
This last field is always after the Attack section.  It dictates how each
enemy decides what to do.  It also covers the effects of how it reacts to
certain attacks via counters.

This part is split into sections:
      Setup:   This is used when battle starts.
      Main:    This is used whenever the enemy may take a turn.
      Counter: This will always have a specific effect that this section can
                 counter, for example: Death, Damage or Physical.  It will
                 be run whenever the enemy experiences the listed effect.

Note that the AI data listed in this document is translated, and is not an
*EXACT* translation of precisely what it's doing behind the scenes.  But it
will always have the same effect and will hopefully be easier to understand
as a result.  There are many cases where I have rewritten the structure of an
AI script so that it takes up less space and is easier to read.  The end
effect should be the same in all cases however.

Also note that much of the time, an AI script has access to many temporary
variables.  These are all reset to 0 at the start of battle, and are
sometimes set to other values in the Setup routine.  However, a lot of the
time, these variables will be used to fulfil specific functions that crop up
time and again.  To aid understanding, here are the names we will give to
certain temporary variables if they're used in a certain way:

      Count:      Often used to determine the order of attacks, or which
                    attack should be used next.
      Stage:      Similar to Count, but often dictates what moves are
                    available and sometimes used to reflect a change in
                    stats.
      SelectTar:  Used to predefine a target for an attack to be used on.
                    Often defined in counterattacks so that the enemy knows
                    who to redirect their anger against.
      SpclChance: Often, the chance for using a certain special effect will
                    change depending on certain situations, like as the
                    enemy nears death.  This variable dictates how often
                    they tend to use these moves.  Lower values generally
                    indicate a higher chance that the enemy will use more
                    desperate attacks.
      CustomVar:  A special TempVar that can be checked by other monsters in
                    the same battle.  These, like other TempVars, will be
                    given names.


In addition, there are GlobalVars and BattleVars.  BattleVars only apply for
the current Battle, but are used by all enemies in the battle.  GlobalVars
affect the entire game.  Whenever an AI Script uses one of these, a unique
description will be allocated to it to describe to you exactly what this
value is used for.  Most BattleVars referenced in this guide are custom
however and don't mean the same thing from battle to battle.

All other temporary variables will be labelled 'TempVar', with a description
after it identifying its general purpose.



A few common commands and terminology will also be described here:

  Choose <Target>
    This sets up a target selection for a later spell to be used.  There are
    many possibilities for targets.  The most common are Random Opponent,
    All Opponents, Self and All Allies.  In the case of Random Opponent, All
    Opponents and All Allies, these do not count targets that are flagged
    as Dead (inflicted with Death and Petrify statuses, for example) by
    default.  If an enemy uses an attack that does affect these kind of
    objects, then it will target one individually or it will be specified in
    the selection - 'All Opponents (incl. Dead)' as an example.  Also note
    that if an enemy Chooses a target that the attack it uses doesn't accept
    (a single target when the attack is an area), then the attack's targets
    take priority, and a random target out of the default list will be chosen
    regardless of who was Chosen.  This can unfortunately lead to a few rare
    bugs.

  x/y Chance
    This is a shorthand to indicate the chance of something happening.  When
    it is grouped with other chances ("1/2 Chance: Attack 1,
    1/2 Chance: Attack 2" for example), then the chances are dependent; in
    the example's case, you have a 50/50 chance of either Attack 1 or
    Attack 2 activating, but not both.  If it is alone in an If statement,
    then it's an independent chance, with nothing else happening if it fails
    (except the 'Else' part of the If statement if it exists) and the AI
    script continuing on as normal.

  Formation ID
    Used to determine whether multiple monsters are part of the same 'group'.
    A Formation ID is visible in battles with multiple monsters of the
    same type by looking at the 'A'/'B'/'C' after the monster's name.
    So, "Hammer Blaster A" has a Formation ID of 0, while "Hammer Blaster B"
    has a Formation ID of 1.

  Set <???> as Self
    Rarely used, this replaces all references to 'Self' and the source of all
    attacks used until the end of the current AI script.


In addition, here's the definition of the various Counter effects:

  Counter - General
    Used immediately after any targetted attack the enemy experiences,
    providing it's still alive and able to do anything.  Otherwise, there's
    very few things it will not react to.  Sense and statuses that miss or
    fail due to immunities will generally not be countered.  Abilities that
    heal HP will be countered.  Also, if the attack has caused the enemy's
    death, then Counter - Death takes priority and Counter - General will not
    be run at all.

  Counter - Death
    Used immediately upon the death or removal of the enemy.  Note that the
    enemy is still considered alive and well until this script has finished
    running.

  Counter - Physical
    Will be used against any physical attack.  Abilities that end up healing
    or removing statuses will not be countered against by this script.

  Counter - Magical
    Will be used against any magical attack.  Abilities that end up healing
    or removing statuses will not be countered against by this script.

  Counter - PreTurn
    Will be used before *ANY* ability made by *ANY* character, INCLUDING the
    enemy's allies or even themselves!  Note that an ability must be used;
    a run through the AI script is not enough.  However, even 'moves' like
    Defend and Change will activate this script.  The script is run before
    the effects of the move/ability are calculated.  In general, it's used to
    set/remove immunities and other effects that may or may not interfere
    with the ability.

Chocobos come in 8 different levels, each with the same basic stats:
  L13, L16, L19, L22, L29, L30, L33, L36
Chocobo's HP = Chocobo's Lvl * 10
Chocobo's MP = Chocobo's Lvl (for L13 and L16)
             = 30            (for L19)
             = 100           (for L22+)

If a Chocobo's HP is reduced to 0, it will automatically counter with
'Chocobo, goes nuts' and 'Escape', leaving no EXP, AP or Gil.

5.4.2 The Mystery Ninja
----- -----------------
Meeting the Mystery Ninja is key to getting to Yuffie.  Mystery Ninja will
rarely appear in most overland forests and jungles, but only before you
acquire Yuffie.  The base chances she will appear in a forest of any
particular area is as follows:

                             Junon Area:  32/256
                           Gongaga Area:  64/256
                             Nibel Area:  64/256
                       Rocket Town Area: 255/256
                         Woodlands Area: 128/256
                            Mideel Area: 128/256
                    Goblin/Round Island: 128/256


In addition, Mystery Ninja has different stats and sometimes different moves
depending on her level.  To determine which level Mystery Ninja you will
fight, Cloud's level is used:

2-Faced will not attack normally; all moves it has are counterattacks.

Although 2-Faced is not immune to Berserk, it does not have a designated
Berserk Attack.  As such, it will try to use a non-existant attack, which
happens to cost more MP than it will ever have.  Because of this, it will
continually print the message "2-Faced's skill power is used up."

Note: The Harpy's Counter - General script sets an unused temporary variable
(SpclChance) which, unfortunately, overwrites the Harpy's knowledge of which
object in battle is the Chocobo (should a Chocobo battle occur).  Thus,
killing a Harpy may not cause immediate capture of the Chocobo.  However, in
most cases, the Chocobo's own AI script should rectify the situation.  Don't
be surprised if you get occassions when the Chocobo runs away immediately
after the Harpy dies, however

Listed above are Golem's default stats.  Immediately after its first turn,
those stats will be reset to:

                 No Advance      1st Advance       2nd Advance
         Att:         48              52                56

         MDf:        130             120               110

Also note that if the Golem is restored to *MORE* HP than he had last time
he countered, it will count as a *COLOSSAL* amount of HP Difference; the
script has no real concept of negative numbers.  This means that a drop of
200 HP or more or a gain of 1 HP or more from the last time the Golem
retreated is enough to make it retreat again.

This is also why the Golem's MAt is so high once battle begins.

If Gi Nattak dies, Soul Fire is removed leaving no XP, AP, Gil or items
(providing it is not already dead)

Soul Fire has two main modes; either in resting position, where it casts
Fire2 on itself continually, or in attack mode, where Gi Nattak has ordered
it to take over a character.  In this mode, it is untargetable, and Soul
Fire will cast Fire2 on that target every chance it gets.  If this casting of
Fire2 is reflected, it will hit the hidden Soul Fire and heal it

The Soul Fire will not emerge unless the possessed character dies or four
turns have passed

5.24 Ultimate Weapon
--------------------
At this point when you return to Mideel, you will face Ultimate Weapon for
the first time.  You will also later have the chance to fight Ultimate Weapon
after defeating Diamond Weapon.  However, the first battle is just as
important as the rest, because Ultimate Weapon's HP carries over after each
battle.  When you meet him first in Mideel, he will have his full complement
of 100,000 HP.  As you face him over successive battles, you can whittle this
down.  Once you reduce him to 20,000 HP or below, he will await you above
Cosmo Canyon where the final battle with him will take place, and you can
finally kill him.

a 1-2 combo of W Machine Gun will be used between 4/6 and 5/6ths of Death
Machine's Max HP, and a 1-2 combo of 100 Needles followed *IMMEDIATELY* by a
1-2 combo of W Machine Gun will be used between 2/6 and 4/6ths of Death

Although Guardian is not immune to Berserk, it does not have a designated
Berserk Attack.  As such, it will try to use a non-existant attack, which
happens to cost more MP than it will ever have.  Because of this, it will
continually print the message "Guardian's skill power is used up."

Appears in groups of three.  Will often use its turn to 'swap manholes';
this causes the current Manhole to close its lid, and one of the other two
to open theirs.  While closed, a Manhole will evade *ANY* attack.  When a
Manhole closes, it copies across its current stats to the opening Manhole.
Once the open Manhole is defeated, the other two Manholes will be removed.
Items, XP, AP and Gil are only awarded for the single Manhole destroyed

Although Manhole is not immune to Berserk, it does not have a designated
Berserk Attack.  As such, it will try to use a non-existant attack, which
happens to cost more MP than it will ever have.  Because of this, it will
continually print the message "Manhole's skill power is used up."

BUG: Turks:Rude's normal aversion to attacking Tifa is improperly coded -
if there's more than one choice of target other than Tifa for him to attack,
he will try to attack *both* of them with a 1 Op-type ability.  Since this
cannot possibly hit two targets at once, Turks:Rude will instead pick a new
random target out of *all three characters*, which includes Tifa.

If Turks:Rude can only choose between Tifa and one other party member (the
third party member being KOed or some other method of making them
untargetable), then the code works correctly and Turks:Rude will never attack
Tifa.  And if Tifa is the final person left, Turks:Rude will hesitate 2/3rds
of the time instead of attacking her.

Although Right Arm is not immune to Berserk, it does not have a designated
Berserk Attack.  As such, it will try to use a non-existant attack, which
happens to cost more MP than it will ever have.  Because of this, it will
continually print the message "Right Arm's skill power is used up."

Does not attack; Helletic Hojo controls this as a separate attack.

'Lifeform-Hojo NA' appears as the name due to FF7's multitarget code.
'Lifeform-Hojo NB' and 'Lifeform-Hojo NC' overwrite the enemy templates where
Right Arm and Left Arm's in-battle data were stored, but they are only used
in this battle as invisible, untargetable enemies in order to fully erase the
Right Arm and Left Arm enemies (to prevent FF7 from trying to access
templates that no longer exist).  Because of this, FF7 believes there's
multiple enemies of the same type in this battle, and hence appends the A to
Lifeform-Hojo N's name

Note: Ruby Weapon also Absorbs Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth and Hidden, but
these are not part of the base template; they are set up only as part of its
AI Script.  In addition, Ruby Weapon is immune to all attacks until the
Tentacles have been revived for the first time

Despite how the battle looks when it starts, it is *not* a normal battle.
You have been Ambushed (despite the lack of Ambush message), so your Time
Bars start empty.  In addition, your entire party have their *back* to Ruby
Weapon, despite it seeming like you're facing him.  The first occurrence of
Big Swing will thus deal Back Attack damage to your party unless you attack
him first.  As stated earlier in this document, attempting to run away to
change your facing will not correct this Back Attack problem

This is Type A: the Gargoyle you meet first in battle.

BUG: Gargoyle's script suggests that it can be removed by using a Soft on it.
However, Soft's effect will never trigger the Counter - General script,
meaning that this never works.  Also note that the script was only meant to
catch use of the Item command; W-Item Soft would never have worked

Transformation: 1st Form is default;
                2nd Form has arms crossed;    Def: 400, MDf: 470
                2nd Form cannot attack
Transforms to 2nd Form if Defense Start is used
Transforms to 1st Form after certain amount of time in 2nd Form

Listed above are Armored Golem's default stats.  Immediately after its first
turn, the stats will be reset to:

             No Advance    1st Advance     2nd Advance     3rd Advance
    Att:         94            98             102             106
    Def:        132           124             116             108
    MAt:         74            80              86              92
    MDf:        160           150             140             130

These stats only apply when in 1st Form.  Any Advance or Retreat made
in 2nd Form will not change any stat from 400 Def, 470 MDf until Armored
Golem returns to 1st Form

Also note that if the Armored Golem is restored to *MORE* HP than he had last
time he countered, it will count as a *COLOSSAL* amount of HP Difference; the
script has no real concept of negative numbers.  This means that a drop of
1000 HP or more or a gain of 1 HP or more from the last time the Armored
Golem retreated is enough to make it retreat again.

5.34.2 Bizarro*Sephiroth
------ -----------------
There are no less than six versions of Bizarro*Sephiroth: fighting with
one party, fighting with two parties (one version for each party), and
fighting with three parties (one version for each party).  Add this to the
huge AI, and this makes Bizarro*Sephiroth the largest boss section in this
document, and deserving of his own explanation.


============================================================================
====                         O N E   P A R T Y                          ====
============================================================================

You will face the single party version if any one of the following are true:

   1. Jenova*SYNTHESIS achieved 13 or more turns before the countdown for
      Ultima started.  Note that this still counts turns where Jenova
      couldn't do anything due to an Arm being dead.  Also note that the
      very first turn Jenova begins the countdown on does not count.

   2. Your lowest levelled party member is L34 or less.  A character in this
      level range automatically earns you the single party version of
      Bizarro*Sephiroth.

   3. The average party level is 53 or less.  Aeris is not included in
      this count, and if you have skipped Yuffie or Vincent, then whoever
      you've skipped will not be included either.  The average is the sum
      of your party's levels divided by the number of party members,
      rounded down.


This version of Bizarro*Sephiroth is the easiest and least complex of the
lot.  The idea is simply to defeat the Main Body (Bizarro*Sephiroth A).
Complicating this is the Core (Bizarro*Sephiroth C) which heals the Main Body
every turn.  At the start of battle, the Core is immune to any attack.
However, defeating Right Magic (Bizarro*Sephiroth D) and Left Magic
(Bizarro*Sephiroth E) makes the Core vulnerable to attack, allowing you to
shut down this healing factor.


When the battle begins, an extra script will set Battle Variable [2160] to
[2160] OR 0x20.  The effect of this is currently unknown.

  Now, here's Bizarro's details:

        Small, Slow-numb, Petrify, Death-sentence, Manipulate, Berserk,
        Peerless, Paralysed, Seizure
        
This is the single party version of Bizarro*Sephiroth

This template is used by all five Bizarro*Sephiroth parts.  The parts will
differ as such:

Main Body's Max HP = 40000 +  5000 * No. of Characters at L99
                   + 60000 if Knights of Round was used on Jenova*SYNTHESIS
Head's Max HP      =  2000 +   250 * No. of Characters at L99
Core's Max HP      = 10000 +  1250 * No. of Characters at L99
Right Mgc's Max HP =  4000 +   500 * No. of Characters at L99
Left Mgc's Max HP  =  4000 +   500 * No. of Characters at L99

Note that Aeris does not count with regards to characters at L99.

Right Magic will absorb Ice and Lightning Elements
Left Magic will absorb Fire and Earth Elements
Core is immune to all attacks until both Right Magic and Left Magic are dead
  The immunity will return if Right and Left Magic are revived

============================================================================

You will face the two party version if you do not qualify for the single
party version, but one of the following is true:

   1. You are missing either Vincent or Yuffie or both.

   2. Your lowest levelled party member is between L35 and L44 inclusive.

   3. The average party level is between 54 and 67 inclusive.


This is a slightly more complex battle.  Cloud's party will face the Right
Side of Bizarro, while your other party must face the Left.  The battle
begins with Cloud.  The objective, again, is to defeat the Main Body
(Bizarro*Sephiroth Main:A).  However, the Right Core (Bizarro*Sephiroth
Main:C) is still healing it every turn.  To complicate matters, defeating
Right Magic (Bizarro*Sephiroth Main:D and Main:E) is no longer enough to make
the Core vulnerable.  It is necessary to defeat a part of Bizarro*Sephiroth
and *then* switch parties to Bizarro's Left Side.

There, the Left Core (Bizarro*Sephiroth Sub:C) is accessible.  While still
immune to attacks, it becomes vulnerable when Left Magic (Bizarro*Sephiroth
Sub:D and Sub:E) is destroyed.  Once the immunity is gone, Left Core may be
destroyed.  Once both Left Core and Right Magic are dead, Right Core in front
of Cloud's party finally becomes vulnerable.  Switching back to Cloud's party
and defeating it finally removes Bizarro's method of healing.

Alternatively, it is possible to simply overpower Bizarro by dealing more
damage than he can heal, which is often considered a much much simpler
method.

Note that when you switch parties, the HP values of all Bizarro*Sephiroth
parts are saved.  When you return to that battle, it is identical to starting
a new battle (all statuses are reset, for example), except that the HP of the
parts are set to their saved value.  Also note that any damage done to a part
in one battle does *NOT* carry over to the other battle; the AI script only
shares Death status, not HP.  Thus, the HP for Bizarro*Sephiroth's head can
be different between two different parties, for example.


When the battle begins, an extra script in both battles will set Battle
Variable [2160] to [2160] OR 0x24.  The effect of this is currently unknown.
In addition, in the Right Side battle, [2180] will be set to 0, and in the
Left Side battle, [2180] will be set to 1.

  On to the stats:

        Peerless, Paralysed, Seizure
        
This is the Right Hand Side (Main Battle) in the Two Party scenario

This template is used by all five Bizarro*Sephiroth parts.  The parts will
differ as such:

Main Body's Max HP = 40000 +  5000 * No. of Characters at L99
                   + 60000 if Knights of Round was used on Jenova*SYNTHESIS
Head's Max HP      =  2000 +   250 * No. of Characters at L99
Core's Max HP      = 14000 +  1750 * No. of Characters at L99
Right Shl's Max HP =  6000 +   750 * No. of Characters at L99
Right Arm's Max HP =  4000 +   500 * No. of Characters at L99

Note that Aeris does not count with regards to characters at L99.

Head shares Death status with the Head in Sub Battle 1
Right Shoulder and Right Arm will absorb Ice and Lightning Elements
Core is immune to all attacks until Right Shoulder and Right Arm are dead,
  *AND* the Core of the 1st Sub Battle is also dead.  The immunity will
  return if Right Shouler/Arm are revived

BUG: Due to a flaw in the AI Script, Bizarro will only successfully record
which parts on this side are dead if Bizarro*Sephiroth E is dead.  If
Right Magic (E) is alive, the death of any other parts on this side of
Bizarro will not be recorded when you change parties

This is the Left Hand Side (Sub Battle 1) in the Two Party scenario

This template is used by all five Bizarro*Sephiroth parts.  The parts will
differ as such:

Main Body's Max HP = 35000 +  5000 * No. of Characters at L99
Head's Max HP      =  2000 +   250 * No. of Characters at L99
Core's Max HP      = 12000 +  1500 * No. of Characters at L99
Left Shl's Max HP  =  6000 +   750 * No. of Characters at L99
Left Arm's Max HP  =  4000 +   500 * No. of Characters at L99

Note that Aeris does not count with regards to characters at L99.

Main Body is untargetable on this side of the battle
Head shares Death status with the Head in the Main Battle
Left Shoulder and Left Arm will absorb Fire and Gravity Elements
Core is immune to all attacks until both Left Shoulder and Left Arm are dead
  The immunity will return if both parts of Left Magic are revived
If Core is destroyed and Right Shoulder and Right Arm in the Main Battle
  are dead, the Core in the Main Battle will lose its immunity

BUG: Due to flaws in the AI script, most of Bizarro's planned attack sequence
will not activate.  You will most likely only see Demi3 and <Sephiroth Shock>
used against you until you lower the Core's defenses.  The reason for this is
that Bizarro mistakenly uses the Turn Counter for Left Core's Defenses
rather than the correct Turn Counter for his attack sequence

BUG: It's also possible that Left Shoulder/Arm were meant to be given Fire
and Earth Absorb rather than Fire and Gravity Absorb, when comparing to the
Single and Three Party battles

====                     T H R E E   P A R T I E S                      ====
============================================================================

Finally, you will get the three party version if you fail to qualify for
the previous two versions.  To be precise, this means that all of the
following is true:

   1. Both Vincent and Yuffie have been recruited into your party.

   2. Jenova*SYNTHESIS only achieved 12 turns or less before she began her
      Ultima countdown.

   3. The lowest level character in your party is L45 or greater.

   4. The average level of the party is 68 or greater.


This is it.  This time, Cloud's party stands dead center, the 2nd party
gets the Right Side of Bizarro and the final party gets the Left Side of
Bizarro.  Defeat of the Main Body (Bizarro*Sephiroth Main:A) again is the
primary goal.  However, you now have three Cores (Main:C, Sub1:C and Sub2:C)
to deal with.  Only the center Core heals the Main Body, but it will only
become vulnerable if the two Sub Cores have been destroyed.

Thus the Left and Right parties must destroy Left and Right Magic
respectively to make the Sub Cores vulnerable, then, in turn, destroy these.
Once this is accomplished, you may destroy the Main Core at your leisure.
The Main Core *cannot* revive either of the Sub Cores, so once the Sub Cores
have been destroyed, there is no chance of the Main Core's immunity
returning.

Once again, you may decide that this is not worth it, and simply wish to
outdamage the amount the Core will heal.

Note that when you switch parties, the HP values of all Bizarro*Sephiroth
parts are saved.  When you return to that battle, it is identical to starting
a new battle (all statuses are reset, for example), except that the HP of the
parts are set to their saved value.  Also note that any damage done to a part
in one battle does *NOT* carry over to the other battle; the AI script only
shares Death status, not HP.  Thus, the HP for Bizarro*Sephiroth's head can
be different between two different parties, for example.


When the battle begins, an extra script in both battles will set Battle
Variable [2160] to [2160] OR 0x24.  The effect of this is currently unknown.
Also, the Center battle will have [2180] set to 0, the Right Side battle
will have [2180] set to 1, and the Left Side Battle will have [2180] set
to 2.

  And now, the details:

This is the Center (Main Battle) in the Three Party scenario

This template is used by all five Bizarro*Sephiroth parts.  The parts will
differ as such:

Main Body's Max HP = 40000 +  5000 * No. of Characters at L99
                   + 60000 if Knights of Round was used on Jenova*SYNTHESIS
Head's Max HP      =  2000 +   250 * No. of Characters at L99
Core's Max HP      = 16000 +  2000 * No. of Characters at L99
Right Mgc's Max HP =  8000 +  1000 * No. of Characters at L99
Left Mgc's Max HP  =  8000 +  1000 * No. of Characters at L99

Note that Aeris does not count with regards to characters at L99.

Head shares Death status with the Heads in all Three Party battles
Right Magic shares Death Status with Right Shoulder in Sub Battle 1
Left Magic shares Death Status with Left Shoulder in Sub Battle 2
Right Magic and Left Magic will absorb Ice and Lightning Elements
Core is immune to all attacks until both Right Core in Sub Battle 1 and Left
  Core in Sub Battle 2 are dead.  This immunity will never return

BUG: Left Magic is mistakenly given Ice and Lightning Absorb, when from
previous battles and the attacks attributed to it, it should really have
Fire and Earth Absorb

This is the Right Hand Side (Sub Battle 1) in the Three Party scenario

This template is used by all five Bizarro*Sephiroth parts.  The parts will
differ as such:

Main Body's Max HP = 35000 +  4000 * No. of Characters at L99
Head's Max HP      =  2000 +   250 * No. of Characters at L99
Core's Max HP      = 12000 +  1500 * No. of Characters at L99
Right Shl's Max HP =  8000 +  1000 * No. of Characters at L99
Right Arm's Max HP =  6000 +   750 * No. of Characters at L99

Note that Aeris does not count with regards to characters at L99.

Main Body is untargetable on this side of the battle
Head shares Death status with the Heads in all Three Party battles
Right Shoulder shares Death status with Right Magic in the Main battle
Right Shoulder and Right Arm will absorb Ice and Lightning Elements
Core is immune to all attacks until both Right Shoulder and Right Arm are
  dead.  The immunity will return if both parts of Right Magic are revived
If Core is destroyed and Left Core in Sub Battle 2 is dead, then the Core in
  the Main Battle will lose its immunity

BUG: Both Three Party Sub Battles will use Heartless Angel instead of Stigma
*IF* the Main Core is still alive.  They will only use Stigma if the Main
Core has been destroyed.  This is clearly at odds with how the previous
battles were set up, and should likely be classed as a bug.  Note that Stigma
is used correctly in the Three Party Main Battle

This is the Left Hand Side (Sub Battle 2) in the Three Party scenario

This template is used by all five Bizarro*Sephiroth parts.  The parts will
differ as such:

Main Body's Max HP = 30000 +  3000 * No. of Characters at L99
Head's Max HP      =  2000 +   250 * No. of Characters at L99
Core's Max HP      = 12000 +  1500 * No. of Characters at L99
Left Shl's Max HP  =  8000 +  1000 * No. of Characters at L99
Left Arm's Max HP  =  6000 +   750 * No. of Characters at L99

Note that Aeris does not count with regards to characters at L99.

Main Body is untargetable on this side of the battle
Head shares Death status with the Heads in all Three Party battles
Left Shoulder shares Death status with Left Magic in the Main battle
Left Shoulder and Left Arm will absorb Fire and Earth Elements
Core is immune to all attacks until both Left Shoulder and Left Arm are dead
  The immunity will return if both parts of Left Magic are revived
If Core is destroyed and Right Core in Sub Battle 1 is dead, then the Core in
  the Main Battle will lose its immunity

BUG: Both Three Party Sub Battles will use Heartless Angel instead of Stigma
*IF* the Main Core is still alive.  They will only use Stigma if the Main
Core has been destroyed.  This is clearly at odds with how the previous
battles were set up, and should likely be classed as a bug.  Note that Stigma
is used correctly in the Three Party Main Battle
