-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOREWORD
--------

For a while after FF7's release, the Gold Saucer Date was a mystery.  People
knew you could date different characters at that part of the plot, but
weren't exactly sure how.  There were a few guides to get some of the harder
characters - notably Yuffie and Barret - but some of them included
unnecessary tasks, or simply failed in execution.

So in early 1999, after a discussion on Usenet, I ran some memory editing
software and started researching it on the PC version.  It took a few days of
replaying various scenes over and over, but the original guide was finished
shortly after, and was submitted to GameFAQs.  And since then, it has
continued to be one of my most popular guides.


Anyways, it's now been almost over ten years since then (and almost nine
since the last update).  And after having updated the Game Mechanics guides,
I thought it'd be a good idea to finish this one up, now that we know so much
more about how FF7 works.

So here it is.  Hope you enjoy it.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE AFFECTION VALUES
--------------------

There are four values in the game, and I have termed them Affection values
for the purpose of this document.  At the start of the game, they are set as
thus:
  Aeris:  50
  Tifa:   30
  Yuffie: 10
  Barret:  0

As the game proceeds, certain decisions or tasks you undertake will amend
them.  When you reach the date, whoever has the highest Affection value will
be the one chosen for the cutscene.  If, however, there is a tie for the
highest, then the priorities are thus: Aeris, then Tifa, then Yuffie, and
finally Barret.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAMESHARK/GAMEHACK CODES
------------------------

This table is for the PSX version, using a GameShark.

                           GameShark (US)    GameShark (UK)   
 Aeris' Affection Value:   3009D28B 00xx     3009D156 00xx
 Tifa's Affection Value:   3009D28C 00xx     3009D157 00xx
 Yuffie's Affection Value: 3009D28D 00xx     3009D158 00xx
 Barret's Affection Value: 3009D28E 00xx     3009D159 00xx



This table is for the PC UK version, using the software known as GameHack.
The Riva column is for those with the latest Riva patch installed (the one
that adds both Riva 128 and Riva TNT compatibility).  It's possible that
these codes will also work for the US version, but I cannot vouch for
them in that respect.

                           GameHack          GameHack (Riva)
 Aeris' Affection Value:   00DB1EC7          00DC08DF
 Tifa's Affection Value:   00DB1EC8          00DC08E0
 Yuffie's Affection Value: 00DB1EC9          00DC08E1
 Barret's Affection Value: 00DB1ECA          00DC08E2


Remember that whoever's Affection Value is *highest* will be the one
showcased on the 'date' sequence.

Due to the fact that I have little access to any version other than the UK
PC version, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the codes listed here, nor
can I provide codes for other versions.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE DECISIONS
-------------

Midgar
------
Talking to Aeris the first time, no matter what you say (believe it or not),
has no effect.  If you buy the flower, you will later have the option to
earn some extra points with either Tifa or Barret.

Talk to Jessie twice on the train home from the first mission:
    "Thanks anyway"         --
    "Looking forward to it" (-3 Tifa)

When you enter Seventh Heaven, and you have a flower:
    "Give it to Tifa"    (+5 Tifa)
    "Give it to Marlene" (+5 Barret)

If you talk to Tifa while she's behind the bar:
    "I don't feel like it"   --

Giving Barret a Materia tutorial has no effect.

Getting to the last car of the train without getting
caught by the Security Lockdown: (+5 Tifa, +5 Barret)

    "(I don't know if I can hold on)" (-3 Barret, +1 Tifa)

The conversation with Aeris after you awaken has no effect
at all.  Treat her anyway you feel like.

    Ask her to fight them      (-1 Aeris)
    Ask her to run             --
    Ask her to run and she
      has to fight             (-1 Aeris)

    "No way!"            (+1 Aeris)
    "Yeah, that's right" (-5 Aeris)

After you get through Sector 6 to the playground:
    "Take her home."     --
    "Go on to Sector 7." (+1 Aeris)

If Tifa is chosen as the Don's date:
    "You all right?"      (+3 Aeris)
    "We gotta help Tifa!" (-2 Aeris)

If Aeris is chosen as the Don's date:
    "You all right?"           (-2 Tifa)
    "We've gotta help Aeris!!" (+3 Tifa)
    (Yes, it *is* that way
     around.  Don't ask me
     why....)

If Cloud is chosen as the Don's date:
    "Yes, his name's Barret..." (+5 Barret)
    (No other choice matters,
     not even almost kissing
     the Don)

When everyone lands in the sewer:
    Talk to Aeris first: (+3 Aeris)
    Talk to Tifa first:  (+3 Tifa)

When you choose your party after escaping Midgar:
    If Barret's in it: (+1 Barret)
    If Aeris is in it: (+1 Aeris)
    If Tifa is in it:  (+1 Tifa)



Kalm
----
When Barret leaves, and tells you to get a move on:
    "Wait a sec"                     --
        "Beautiful, just beautiful!" (+3 Barret)
        "Is that all?"               (-1 Barret)
    "Right"                          (+1 Barret)

Talking to a woman in Kalm, who says Mako energy is convenient:
    "Yeah, maybe"       (-2 Barret) if Barret is in party
                        (-1 Aeris) if Aeris is in party
                        (-1 Tifa) if Tifa is in party
                        (+1 Yuffie) if Yuffie is in party
    "You're full of it" (+2 Barret) if Barret is in party
                        (+1 Aeris) if Aeris is in party
                        (+1 Tifa) if Tifa is in party
                        (-1 Yuffie) if Yuffie is in party

Talking to a girl upstairs, who thinks the old life is better:
    "Yeah, maybe" (+2 Barret) if Barret is in party
                  (+1 Aeris) if Aeris is in party
                  (+1 Tifa) if Tifa is in party
                  (-1 Yuffie) if Yuffie is in party
    "No way"      (-2 Barret) if Barret is in party
                  (-1 Aeris) if Aeris is in party
                  (-1 Tifa) if Tifa is in party
                  (+1 Yuffie) if Yuffie is in party



Fort Condor
-----------
When you first talk to the old guy in Fort Condor:
    "I guess so"     (+5 Barret, +3 Aeris, +3 Tifa, +2 Yuffie)
    "Not interested" (-5 Barret, -3 Aeris, -3 Tifa, -1 Yuffie)

After the old guy tells you about his problem:
    "All right"      (+5 Barret, +3 Aeris, +3 Tifa, +2 Yuffie)
    "Not interested" (-5 Barret, -3 Aeris, -3 Tifa, -1 Yuffie)



Meeting Yuffie
--------------
You can fail this as many times as you like, and you'll still get the
points every time you meet Yuffie until you get her in your party.  The
points will continue to increase until they reach 30 or more, at which point
any further increases will be ignored.
    "All right"               --
    "Not interested"          (+2 Yuffie)

    "Petrified..."            (+2 Yuffie)
    "You're gonna lose again" --

    "Go ahead"                --
    "Wait a second!"          (+2 Yuffie)

    "That's right"            (+2 Yuffie)
    "You kiddin'?"            --

    "What's your name?"       --
    "Let's hurry"             (+2 Yuffie)



The Cargo Ship
--------------
On the Cargo Ship, if Yuffie asks you for Tranquilizers:
    "Here, use this" (+4 Yuffie)
    "Nope"           (-2 Yuffie)

If you don't have any Tranquilizers, then it's simply: (-2 Yuffie)

When Aeris asks you about the Airship:
    "I'll take you someday" (+2 Aeris)
    "I dunno..."            (-2 Aeris)

When Tifa asks you about war:
    "Yeah..."      (+2 Tifa)
    "I don't know" (-2 Tifa)



Costa Del Sol
-------------
I was *very* disappointed with Costa Del Sol; there are a lot of dialogue
options that you could choose, but none of them alter Affection values at
all, not even the ones that seem to *really* annoy the girls.



Mt Corel
--------
Stealing the Phoenix Downs from the Cokatolis nest does nothing to alter
Affection values.  Neither does finding it but leaving it alone, for that
matter.  And no, it doesn't even matter who is in your party at the time.
Another wasted opportunity, in my opinion.



Gold Saucer
-----------
When you first enter the Gold Saucer, you will have the option of talking to
members of your party and asking them to accompany you:
    Talking to Aeris:
        Go together                 (+3 Aeris)
        Don't go together           (-2 Aeris)
    Talking to Tifa:
        Go together                 (+3 Tifa)
        Don't go together           (-2 Tifa)
    Talking to Yuffie:
        Go together                 (+3 Yuffie)
        Don't go together           (-2 Yuffie)
    Talking to Red XIII:
        Go together                 --
        Don't go together           --

Only the first of the above Affection changes may be made: if you decline
Aeris first, you'll get -2 Aeris, but you will be unable to get a +3 Tifa as
well, for example.

You can decline Red XIII for no effect and still get an Affection change by
talking to one of the others.  If you ask Red XIII to come along though, the
rest of the Affection changes are locked off.

If you leave the area without choosing a partner, the character with the
highest Affection will automatically join you, and no changes will be made.
If Barret has the highest Affection, then Red XIII will join instead.



Corel Prison
------------
Depending on who you choose first to accompany Barret to see Dyne:
    Aeris:    (+10 Aeris)
    Tifa:     (+3 Tifa)
    Yuffie:   (+2 Yuffie)
    Red XIII: --



Gongaga
-------
After either Aeris or Tifa (or both) meets Zack's parents:
    Ignoring Aeris                  (-3 Aeris)
    Talking to Aeris                --
        "Poor guy"                  (+1 Aeris)
        "(...jealous...envious...)" (+2 Aeris)
    Ignoring Tifa                   (-3 Tifa)
    Talking to Tifa                 (+1 Tifa)
       (doesn't matter what
        you say to her)



Cosmo Canyon
------------
When you first enter Cosmo Canyon, the entire party will split up.  If
Barret was in your party when this occurs, then you will be able to find him
in the room behind Tiger Lily's weapon shop, where he'll offer to talk more
about AVALANCHE.
        "Go on"                     (+3 Barret) 
        "Not really"                --

        "And then?"                 (+3 Barret)
        "Yeah, whatever..."         --

Choosing the non-scoring options halts the dialogue, but you can talk to
Barret again to resume it at that point.  Also, if you leave the room after
picking "Yeah, whatever...", you can return immediately to start the
conversation from scratch.  This scripting oversight allows you to get the
first +3 Barret as many times as you like, so long as you don't get the
second +3.



Wutai
-----
After Yuffie gives back all your Materia in Wutai: (+10 Yuffie)

Note that you only get this bonus if Cloud is leading the party.  However,
since this part of the Wutai subquest closes off before you get the
opportunity to have a different party leader, it'll never really matter.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVENTS BASED ON AFFECTION
-------------------------
A few events in the game besides the Date check the various Affection values.
These have the following effects.


Gold Saucer
-----------
If you do not choose to go with anyone when you first enter the Gold Saucer,
then the character with the highest Affection will automatically join you.
If Barret has the highest Affection, then Red XIII will join you instead.


Gongaga
-------
If you react to Aeris talking about Zack with jealousy, Aeris will say
"I was hoping maybe you were..." if she has more than 120 Affection.
However, it is impossible to get her Affection value this high throughout the
normal course of the game, so you will never see this without cheating.

No matter how you respond to Tifa when she talks about Zack, if you have
more than 120 Affection, she'll remark that she's as proud of you joining
SOLDIER as if it had been her.  Again, it's very difficult to get the value
this high, but unlike Aeris, you can use repeatable increases in order to see
this.


After the Date
--------------
Aeris will automatically join your party when you're preparing to go to the
Temple of the Ancients.  The other party member will be chosen out of
whoever has the highest Affection out of Tifa, Yuffie and Barret, with Tifa
having highest priority in ties and Barret having the lowest.


Before the Crater
-----------------
Right after the Midgar Raid, there will eventually be a scene when Tifa and
Cloud are alone, spending a night just outside the Highwind.  If Tifa's
Affection is 50 or more, the dialogue between them will be slightly different
and reflect the greater affection.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISC. NOTES AND BUGS
--------------------
There were to be some extra dialogue in Sector 7 at the start of the game
that would affect Barret's and Tifa's values, but various things seem to
prevent you from triggering these -- the way the events surrounding Tifa
and Cloud's promise play out seems to have changed during development.

Barret was going to have something to say in Gongaga, but a script error
way back in the Sector 5 Church prevents this from occurring.



Events in battle were going to have an effect on the Date: they had a
secondary system in place that still works fine behind the scenes.  At the
start of the game, Barret, Aeris, Tifa and Yuffie would have another value
called Battle Affection, which starts at 100 and has a minimum of 50 and a
maximum of 200 points.  These would then be adjusted in the following manner
during each battle:

   * If Cloud uses Cover on a character:  +3 Battle Affection
   * If Cloud revives a character:        +4 Battle Affection
   * If Cloud heals a character:          +2 Battle Affection

   * If Cloud hurts but doesn't kill a    -2 Battle Affection
       character:
   * If Cloud kills a character:          -4 Battle Affection
   * If the character has Death status    -5 Battle Affection
       at the end of the battle:

This was likely going to be used as a multiplier to normal Affection values
when you finally reached the Date sequence.  However, the script ignores
these values and just uses the base Affection values.  As such, Battle
Affection affects absolutely nothing throughout the entire game.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GUIDES TO DATING YUFFIE/BARRET
------------------------------
So, you picked up this guide to date Yuffie or Barret, and can't be bothered
trying to go through the above?  Well, I can give a full list of things to
do to guarantee dating one of the two.  However, you shouldn't feel you have
to follow them religiously: there is a fair amount of leeway available in
where and when you get your points.  So don't feel too restricted, and try
to keep track of what you've already done.

Also note that both Yuffie and Barret have available exploits that allow you
to get high Affection values through one repeatable scene, so you can always
abuse that if you have trouble.

Here are two complete guides; the first to date Yuffie, the second to date
Barret.  They are list of all the tasks you can do to get the highest amount
of leeway for that character.  Note the differences by the way in what you
have to do; it's rather interesting at times....


Yuffie:
  1. Don't buy a flower from Aeris when you first see her in Sector 8.
  2. Talk to Jessie twice on the train home from Sector 8, and tell her
you're "Looking forward to it".
  3. Don't talk to Tifa while she's behind the bar.  If you do, decline her
offer for a drink.
  4. Say "...Sorry" when she asks you if you've forgotten your promise.
  5. Ignore Tifa the next morning; don't talk to her, and go straight to
Barret.
  6. Get caught by the Security Lockdown; do not reach the end of the train.
Force Barret and Tifa to jump out early this way.
  7. After defeating Airbuster, before Cloud falls, tell Barret to "Be
strong".
  8. When Aeris is fleeing the guards, climb up to the top level and tell her
to Wait each time.  Then, push the *wrong* barrel (so that she has to fight
the guard anyway).  Do this three times.
  9. When Aeris asks if Tifa is your girlfriend, say "Yeah, that's right."
  10.  When you get to the playground in Sector 6, tell Aeris that you'll
"Take her home."
  11. Get none of the best items so that Tifa is chosen for the Don's
date.  When you meet Aeris outside the Don's office, tell her "We gotta help
Tifa!"
  12. When everyone lands in the sewer, talk to Aeris first.
  13. When Marlene asks you how you feel about Aeris, tell her "I don't
know".
  14. When you first meet Red XIII, tell Tifa to take care of Aeris (keep
Barret in your party for *this* battle).
  15. After the battle with HO512, split up into a team of Cloud, Barret and
Red XIII.
  16. When Tifa asks if you can break out, tell her "(Kinda hard)"
  17. Think about Red XIII first, Barret second, and Aeris last while you're
in the cell.
  18. When you finally escape Midgar and have to choose your team, pick a
team with Cloud, Barret and Red XIII.
  19. In Kalm, after the flashback, tell Barret to "Wait a sec", then
"Is that all?"
  20. Make a party immediately afterwards with Cloud, Aeris and Tifa.  In a
house in Kalm, there's a woman who asks you about whether Mako energy is
convenient.  Tell her "Yeah, maybe".  Talk to the girl upstairs,
and when she asks you if the old life is better, say "No way".
  21. In Fort Condor, disagree twice to the old guy about his plight.  After
that, you can go into Fort Condor and agree then, but that's up to you.
  22. Find Yuffie in Junon Forest.  Get her into your party.  (Take as long
as you like, but this guide will assume you got her first time, and she
didn't run away....)
  23. On the Cargo Ship, give Yuffie a tranquilizer.  (Make sure you bought
one in Junon Town.)
  24. On the Cargo Ship, tell Aeris "I dunno..." when she asks about the
Airship.
  25. On the Cargo Ship, when Tifa asks you about war, say "I don't know".
  26. At the Gold Saucer, when you split up, talk to Yuffie first, and take
her with you (do not choose Aeris or Tifa).
  27. When you see Barret again in the Corel Prison, and you're about to go
after Dyne, you will be prompted to make a party.  Choose Cloud, Barret, and
Yuffie.
  28. Before entering Gongaga Town, make your party into Cloud, Aeris and
Tifa.  Then, when you meet Zack's parents, and Aeris and Tifa leave, ignore
*both* of them and leave town.
  29. Complete the Wutai subquest, and let Yuffie steal your Materia.  After
you get the Materia back, continue on with the story.  You should end up with
Yuffie during the date sequence later.

Ending Affection Scores
  Yuffie: 37
  Aeris:  21
  Tifa:   16
  Barret: 0


Barret:
  1. Buy a flower from Aeris when you see her in Sector 8.
  2. Talk to Jessie twice on the train home from Sector 8, and tell her
you're "Looking forward to it".
  3. Give the flower to Marlene when you get the option.
  4. Don't talk to Tifa while she's behind the bar.  If you do, decline her
offer for a drink.
  5. Say "...Sorry" when she asks you if you've forgotten your promise.
  6. Say "Barret's snoring kept me up..." when she asks you how you slept the
next morning.
  7. Don't get caught by the Security Lockdown; get to the end of the train.
  8. After defeating Airbuster, before Cloud falls, tell Barret to "Be
strong".
  9. When Aeris is fleeing the guards, climb up to the top level and tell her
to Wait each time.  Then, push the *wrong* barrel (so that she has to fight
the guard anyway).  Do this three times.
  10. When Aeris asks if Tifa is your girlfriend, say "Yeah, that's right."
  11. When you get to the playground in Sector 6, tell Aeris that you'll
"Take her home."
  12. Get *all* the best items so that Cloud is chosen for the Don's date
(not Tifa or Aeris).  Tell the Don that there's someone else, and when he
asks who, tell him "Yes, his name's Barret..."
  13. When everyone lands in the sewer, talk to Aeris first.
  14. When Marlene asks you how you feel about Aeris, tell her "I don't
know".
  15. When you first meet Red XIII, tell Barret to take care of Aeris (keep
Tifa in your party for *this* battle).
  16. After the battle with HO512, split up into a team of Cloud, Barret and
Red XIII.
  17. When Tifa asks if you can break out, tell her "(Kinda hard)"
  18. Think about Barret first, Red XIII second, and Aeris last while you're
in the cell.
  19. When you finally escape Midgar and have to choose your team, pick a
team with Cloud, Barret and Red XIII.
  20. In Kalm, after the flashback, tell Barret to "Wait a sec", then
"Beautiful, just beautiful!"
  21. Make a party immediately afterwards with Barret, Cloud and Red XIII.
In a house in Kalm, there's a woman who asks you about whether Mako energy
is convenient.  Tell her "You're full of it".  Talk to the girl upstairs,
and when she asks you if the old life is better, say "Yeah, maybe".
  22. In Fort Condor, agree twice to the old guy about his plight.
  23. You don't have to meet Yuffie; in fact, it's probably better if you
don't.  But you can if you want to.  Just make sure you get her the first
time, and don't make her run away.
  24. On the Cargo Ship, don't give Yuffie a tranquilizer.
  25. On the Cargo Ship, tell Aeris "I dunno..." when she asks about the
Airship.
  26. On the Cargo Ship, when Tifa asks you about war, say "I don't know".
  27. At the Gold Saucer, when you split up, talk to Aeris first, then
decide you won't go with her.  After that, choose to take whoever you want
(even Aeris).
  28. When you see Barret again in the Corel Prison, and you're about to go
after Dyne, you will be prompted to make a party.  Choose Cloud, Barret, and
either Red XIII or Cait Sith.  *DO NOT CHOOSE AERIS*!  She gets a heck of a
boost if she gets chosen, and will mess up almost everything you've worked
for.
  29. Before entering Gongaga Town, make your party into Cloud, Aeris and
Tifa.  Then, when you meet Zack's parents, and Aeris and Tifa leave, ignore
*both* of them and leave town.
  30. Before entering Cosmo Canyon, add Barret to your party.  When the party
splits up inside Cosmo Canyon, enter the room behind Tiger Lily's Weapon
Shop, and encourage Barret to continue talking until he no longer has
anything new to say.  Alternatively, it's possible to max out your points
here if you pick the first and then second option, leave the room, and then
return to talk to Barret again: every time you say "Go on" you gain +3 Barret
and choosing "Yeah, whatever..." allows you to leave the room and reset the
conversation.  The scores below will assume you do not abuse this bug though.
  31. Do not go anywhere near Wutai if you have Yuffie.  Instead, continue
through the game normally.  When you finally get to the date sequence, you
should find Barret wanting to talk to you.

There, that's it.  I would like to thank the makers of GameHack, without
which, I would never have been able to accomplish this task all those years
ago.  Also, heartfelt thanks to those at alt.games.final-fantasy.rpg, who
helped test this out when I first researched this.  Most have moved on, of
course, but I remember it as a fun community while I was there.

More recent thanks go to those at Qhimm's Forums, where much of the script
translating went on.  It truly is a learning experience when you start
seeing exactly what's going on under the hood.

Thanks for reading this, and I hope this document has helped you in some
small way.
