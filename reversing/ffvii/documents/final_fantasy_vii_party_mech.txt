COMPONENT GUIDES
----------------

The FF7 Game Mechanics Guides are split into three files.  This guide, the
second in the series, will detail how the basic battle formulas apply to
Cloud's party, covering limit breaks, materia and items.  The other two
are:

  The FF7 Battle Mechanics:
    Covers the battle mechanics as a whole, and is required reading for
  understanding this current guide.

  The FF7 Enemy Mechanics:
    A list of enemies focusing on their attacks and attributes, and how the
  damage from those attacks are factored into the battle mechanics formulas.


The FF7 Battle Mechanics is the main one to start with, since it will define
many terms that will be used in both Party and Enemy Mechanics.

Note that this guide is based on the PC version.  While most alleged
gameplay differences between the PC and PSX versions have been proven false,
more may exist.


I apologise for the layout of some of the tables and associated data, but
some things are very difficult to both explain adequately and present in a
concise and understandable manner.  If you have questions about any aspect
of this guide, please direct them to the FF7 GameFAQs Message Boards.

1. LEVELS

---  ---------------
1.1  Starting Levels
---  ---------------
Each character has the following starting stats:

              Lvl   HP  MP Str Vit Mag Spr Dex Lck     XP
Cloud           6  314  54  20  16  19  17   6  14    610
Barret          1  222  15  15  13  11   9   5  13     10
Tifa            1  219  16  11  11  11  10   7  14      8
Aeris           1  177  23  10  11  13  14   5  14      0
Red XIII        1  221  17  10  12  11  10  10  14     12
Yuffie          1  100   5   1   1   1   1   1   1      0
Cait Sith       1  224  18  10  11  13  11   5  15     14
Vincent         1  178  18   9  10  11  11   5  14     16
Cid             1  223  15  12  12  11  10   6  14     18

Young Cloud     1  140   4  12  12  11  10   6   5     12
Sephiroth      50 3840 460  85  72  68  70  65  46 320438


Starting stats aren't as important as they seem, as we'll see in the upcoming
sections.  Look at Yuffie, for example, who has the lowest starting stats
without question.  She joins at L17 minimum though, and by that time, her
stats will have normalised; level growth is much more important than starting
stats.  But we will cover that more later.

As you may have noticed, almost all characters begin the game at L1.  This is
their base level.  However, when you are given the chance to rename them,
they are automatically given a certain amount of XP to bring them up to
around the party's level.  The formula used for each character is thus:

Cl = Cloud's Level            Br = Barret's Level
Tf = Tifa's Level             Ae = Aeris' Level
Rd = Red XIII's Level         Yu = Yuffie's Level
Ca = Cait Sith's Level        Vi = Vincent's Level
Ci = Cid's Level              YC = Young Cloud's Level
Se = Sephiroth's Level

Av = Average Party Level (rounded down, only counts characters
                           who have already joined you)

Barret:    Gains BrXP(Av - 1) XP
Tifa:      Gains TfXP(Av - 2) XP
Aeris:     Gains AeXP(Av - 3) XP
Red XIII:  Gains RdXP(Av + 2) XP
Yuffie:    Gains YuXP(Mystery Ninja's Level) XP
Cait Sith: Gains CaXP(Av) XP
Vincent:   Gains ViXP(Av + 3) XP
Cid:       Gains CiXP(Av + 3) XP

NOTE: The functions BrXP, TfXP, AeXP and so on will be defined in the next
subsection.  For now, they are just defined as the total XP required for the
requisite character to reach the indicated level.  Example: YuXP(17) would
be the total amount of XP required for Yuffie to reach L17.

NOTE: The maximum a character may be auto-levelled to is 98.

BUG: When you first start the game, Cloud is listed as requiring 645 Total XP
to achieve L7.  This is a bug with the XPTNL count at the start of the game;
it will correct itself after the first battle.


---  -------------------
1.2  Required Experience
---  -------------------
The Total XP required for each level is generated via both an iterative
formula and a single lookup table.  For simplicity though, I have created a
second lookup table that will be used in this formula.

The first lookup table, Q(<char>,<level>) below, denotes the modifier for the
quadratic function.  Example: Q(Re,25) = 74

Level     Cl    Br    Tf    Ae    Re    Yu    Ca    Vi    Ci       YC    Se
 2-11     68    70    68    67    68    69    69    70    69      130    68
12-21     71    73    71    70    71    72    72    72    72      140    71
22-31     73    75    73    72    74    75    75    75    75      140    73
32-41     74    76    74    74    75    75    75    76    75      110    74
42-51     74    77    75    74    75    76    75    76    76       90    74
52-61     74    77    75    75    75    76    76    76    76       70    74
62-81     75    77    75    76    76    77    76    76    77       48    75
82-99     77    77    76    78    76    77    76    76    77       27    77


The second lookup table, S(<number>,<level>), uses the quadratic modifier to
get a starting value.  Example: S(74,25) = 24493

Level   68  69   70   71    72    73     74     75      76      77      78

62-71    -   -    -    -     -     -      - 581467  589211  596961       -
72-81    -   -    -    -     -     -      - 913752  925925  938105       -
82-91    -   -    -    -     -     -      -      - 1371319 1389359 1407407
92-99    -   -    -    -     -     -      -      - 1940593 1966123 1991662

(Young Cloud's experience points cannot be calculated using this second
lookup table.  Please refer to the second formula that only uses the first
lookup table if you're interested in them)


In addition, here's the final level requirement for L99 for the four relevant
mods - in case that's all you're interested in:

  Mod 76:    2,420,933 XP  (Cloud, Barret, Yuffie, Cid, Sephiroth)
  Mod 77:    2,452,783 XP  (Tifa, Red XIII, Cait Sith, Vincent)
  Mod 78:    2,484,643 XP  (Aeris)
  Mod 27:      860,038 XP  (Young Cloud)



From all this, the Total XP Required to get to any single level can be worked
out.

First, we define the following:
  Chr = Character who's XP progression we will be using
  Lvl = The Level we want to work out the Total XP for
  XLv = [(Lvl - 2) / 10] * 10 + 2    (Example: if Lvl = 18, XLv = 12) 
  SLv = Lvl - XLv                    (Example: if Lvl = 18, SLv =  6)

Then:
  Mod   = Q(Chr,Lvl)
  Start = S(Mod,Lvl)

Start is the total XP required for Chr to reach XLv.  We have to use this
recursively to reach the level we want.  To do this, we must define a
For-Next loop to do this:

XP = Start
If (SLv > 0) then
  For I = 0 to SLv-1
    XP = XP + [Mod * ((XLv + I) ^ 2) / 10]
  Next I
End If


When that loop has finished, XP will hold the total XP required for Chr to
reach the level: Lvl.  We define XP for this as: ChrXP(Lvl).  (For example,
BrXP(35) would be the total XP required for Barret to reach L35)

It is unfortunate that this formula has to be defined this way, but this is
due to the [] function in the middle of the loop.  It is hoped that the above
has been made as easy to understand as possible, but there was no way to
avoid the use of pseudocode at this juncture.

A demonstration of the code at work now follows, in the hopes that it will
make things clearer.


Let us see how much XP Vincent requires to reach L85.  That means that:
  Chr = Vi
  Lvl = 85
  XLv = [(85 - 2) / 10] * 10 + 2
      = 82
  SLv = 85 - 82
      = 3

From there, we get:
  Mod   = Q(Vi,85)
        = 76
  Start = S(76,85)
        = 1371319

Since SLv > 0, we must go through the loop.

XP = 1371319
For I = 0 to 2
  XP = XP + [76 * ((82 + I) ^ 2) / 10]
Next I

Therefore:
  XP = XP + [76 * 82^2 / 10] + [76 * 83^2 / 10] + [76 * 84^2 / 10]
     = 1371319 + 51102 + 52356 + 53625
     = 1528402

Having finished, we finally learn that Vincent requires 1,528,402 XP in total
to achieve L85.  Thus:
  ViXP(85) = 1528402


 ---

As explained earlier, the second lookup table - S(,) - is not needed at all.
To calculate the total experience required at a certain level, we need only
use the first lookup table.  The formula and pseudocode is as follows:

  Chr = Character who's XP progression we will be using
  Lvl = The Level we want to work out the Total XP for

  Mod = Q(Chr,Lvl)
  XP  = 0
  For I = 1 to Lvl-1
    XP = XP + [Mod * (I ^ 2) / 10]
  Next I

Once the loop is finished, XP is the total experience required for Chr to
reach Lvl.

As you can see, this second method is slightly slower since we must begin
from 1 everytime we wish to work out the total XP required.  However, it is
more true to the way FF7 works.


The experience required to reach Lvl from Lvl-1 is just:
  XPTNL = [Mod * ((Lvl-1) ^ 2) / 10]

Note that the above formula only works when Lvl is not 12, 22, 32, etc.
This is because for many characters, the Mod changes at these levels, often
requiring more XP.  This is why we must begin the calculations at L1 each
time we want to find out exactly how much XP is needed for a current level.
This is also why Young Cloud will often gain several levels at once at
higher levels; his Mod drops fantastically past L31, which usually means that
the XP he has earned to get to his current level is more than enough to give
him a few more levels as well.


The table S(,) is simply the results from the above formula when Lvl = 2,
12, 22, 32, and so on.  Only the results needed for the characters are in
the table listed above, but if you wish, you can work out the value for all
the cells labelled with a '-' by hand.  It is not recommended though.


NOTE: The maximum level it is possible to attain in FF7 is 99.  Attempting to
work out the XP requirements for levels greater than 99 will return a value
of 0 XPTNL, but no level up will ever take place.  However, XP is still
accumulated and will continue to do so...

NOTE: Sephiroth and Young Cloud appear to break the rules outlined above.
Young Cloud starts with 12 XP and requires 128 extra XP to reach L2.
Sephiroth starts with 320,438 XP and requires 59562 extra XP to reach L51.
However, this is due to the fact that their XPTNL is initialised differently,
and is never corrected.  In actuality, Sephiroth and Young Cloud, if they did
gain experience, would follow the values listed under Se and YC respectively
in the first lookup table.


---  ------------------
1.3  Earning Experience
---  ------------------
Once a character is classed as a member of your party, they will gain
experience under the following circumstances:

Inside party, not flagged as Dead:   XP
Inside party, flagged as Dead:       0
Outside party:                       [XP/2]
  where XP is the total XP count of the monsters killed.


As noted, XP is not divided among the party members, so you are not penalised
on the size of your party.

On top of that, if a party member leaves your entire party such that they can
no longer be chosen in the PHS menu, then they will gain no XP until they
rejoin at a later date.  There are a number of story-related events where
this will occur, but usually they're short enough that there's no great loss.



*** WARNING: The next section has lots and lots of tables, and in a 78-char
text document, these tables are *VERY* difficult to make legible without
creating a lot of bloat.  In addition, the data most of the tables will have
isn't very intuitive, and the combined effect makes them difficult to scan
through.  My apologies in advance for this.  Analysis of some of the figures
will be present in Section 1.5 - Level Up! Summary.  If you just want to see
what kind of stats the characters will have at L99, just skip to the next
section. ***

---  ---------
1.4  Level Up!
---  ---------
When you gain a level, you earn increases to all Primary Stats as well as
extra HP and MP.  How much they increase is random, and depends on the stat,
the character and your current level.

Let's look over the Primary Stats first.  FF7 uses a group of 30 different
levels - 0 to 29 - to 'grade' the first five stats (Str, Vit, Mag, Spr and
Dex), with the lowest numbers - in general - providing the best curves.

First, let's look at how each of the characters are graded in these five
stats:

                         Str   Vit   Mag   Spr   Dex
            =================================================
                 Cloud     1     6     3     4    26
                Barret     5     2    18    14    29
                  Tifa     6    18    16     9    25
                 Aeris    23    20     0     1    28
                   Red    12    11    13     9    23
                Yuffie    16    19    11    10    24
             Cait Sith    19    22     6     4    28
               Vincent    21    22     6     4    28
                   Cid    11     7    17    15    27
            =================================================

Generally, the lower the number, the better the curve that has been assigned
to that stat.  It's easy to see, now, that Aeris has the best gains in Magic
and the worst in Str.  We can also see, for example, that Cloud is a very
well rounded character with high gains in everything.



Now let's look at the curves themselves.

Do you remember how the Level Mod changed every so many levels in the
previous section?  We will call these ranges Level Brackets, and there are
eight of them in total: L2-11, L12-21, L22-31, L32-41, L42-51, L52-61,
L62-81 and L82-99.  Which bracket you're in depends on which level you're
about to gain: going from L11 to L12 would put you in the L12-21 bracket.

The curves are defined by two numbers per bracket: a base and a gradient.
Let's go over a single example: the Base for the Rank 0 Curve for L2-11 is
12, and the Gradient is 130.  The two numbers are used in the following way:

    Baseline Stat = Base + [Gradient * Level / 100]

So, if you were about to earn L5 and were using the Rank 0 Curve, the
Baseline would be:

    12 + [130 * 5 / 100]
  = 12 + [6.5]
  = 12 + 6
  = 18


This first table will show the Gradient and Base for all 30 Curves, which is
the data necessary to work out every single curve for the first five stats.

Now that the Baseline for the next Level has been found, we must still work
out how much the current Stat may rise.  This is worked out by first
calculating the following value:

             Stat Difference = Rnd(1..8) + Baseline - Current Stat


This difference is then capped at 0 to 11 inclusive, and then the following
table is used to look up the final stat gain:

                          Difference   Stat Gain
                             0- 3          0
                             4- 6          1
                             7- 9          2
                            10-11          3


From this, we can see that you can only go a maximum of 5 points over the
Baseline before you cannot gain any more points, and if you are more than 8
points under the Baseline, you will automatically get the full 3 point gain.
Over the course of 98 levels, this makes sure that you never stray too far
from your intended average stat.

Note: Your Primary Stats are *capped* at 100; it is impossible to push them
over that.  Even if the Baseline is greater than 100 for your level, you will
still be unable to achieve more than 100 in that Stat.  Using Sources or
wearing Equipment and Accessories does *NOT* increase your Base Stats, and
thus does not affect the rate you get stat increases through gaining levels.



Luck uses the same curve system that we've just detailed, including the same
Stat Gain system.  However, instead of being ranked in the 30 level Curve
system we went over, they have their own unique levels.  We will instead list
the Baseline formulas for the Luck of each character manually.

Finally, HP and MP use a related formula each.  Their Baseline is calculated
from Base and Gradient like so:

              HP Baseline = Base +  (Level - 1) * Gradient
              MP Baseline = Base + [(Level - 1) * Gradient / 10]

...and their difference is calculated as a percentage of Current HP or MP:

        Difference = Rnd(1..8) + [100 * Baseline / Current Stat] - 100


The Difference is then capped between 0 and 11%, and the Stat Gain is looked
up on the following tables:

                      HP                                MP
            Difference   Stat Gain            Difference   Stat Gain

                 1%         50%                    1%         30%
                 2%         50%                    2%         30%
                 3%         60%                    3%         50%
                 4%         70%                    4%         70%
                 5%         80%                    5%         80%
                 6%         90%                    6%         90%
                 7%        100%                    7%        100%
                 8%        110%                    8%        110%
                 9%        120%                    9%        120%
                10%        130%                   10%        140%
                11%        150%                   11%        160%


Finally, the base HP gain you get is equal to the Gradient of the curve.  For
instance, Cloud's L82-99 Gradient is 98, so the maximum HP he can gain from a
level is 150% of 98, or 147.  The minimum for him in that level bracket
would, of course, be 40% of 98, or 58 (remember to round down).

MP gain is similar to HP, but we have to be more careful.  The base MP gain
is equal to:

   Base MP Gain = [Level * Gradient / 10] - [(Level - 1) * Gradient / 10]

Essentially, it is the difference between the Baseline for your current
level and the Baseline for the level after, with the important difference
that they both use the same level bracket.  For example, if you were trying
to gain L12, the Gradient used would be from the L12-21 bracket, *NOT* from
the L2-11 bracket.


This leaves only the HP and MP Gradient/Base tables to list.  First, the
HP Tables.  Note that a minus sign means that the Base is negative.  Also,
please remember that the columns indicate the bracket of the Level you are
trying to *EARN*, not the Level you are at currently:

than that.

1.5  Level Up! Summary
---  -----------------
Once again, apologies for the mass of mostly incomprehensible data.  However,
it was necessary to show all that so that we can demonstrate where the
following short analysis now comes from.  We can now provide the minimum and
maximum stats a character may have, for example.

Let's start with that simple analysis first: the maximum and minimum base
stats the characters can get.  Please note that for the maximum and minimum
HP values, you cannot *always* take the max/min gain possible each level.
Some levels, you may have to take a lower gain in order to achieve a better
one on the next level.  The difference between these two strategies, however,
is always less than 10 HP at L99.

NOTE: The strategies required to max out HP and MP will be given in the
Appendix at the end of this document.  Do not assume it is easy.  Most maxing
can be done in the last 50 levels however, with the exact margin for error
depending on the character, the stat, and how high above or below the average
you are when you start.  The reason for this is how FF7 reduces your stat
gains when you're over the baseline for your level; it's relatively easy to
catch up again even if you're well below average in a particular stat, simply
with a few lucky rolls.

But, you should know that achieving max HP requires that you must take lower
than max gains at some levels, and that achieving max MP requires around 50
to 60 levels of max gains, depending on the character and your MP when you
start maxing.

And yes, Barret can max out his HP naturally.  He's the only character that
can achieve 9999 HP without external modifiers (ie Materia).  No character
can naturally get 999 MP though.


So, now we've got a better view of where each character's strengths lie.
Now, for a moment, let's instead look at Cloud's stats at various key levels.

NOTE: Only the average gain per level was taken; the real averages differ
slightly from those shown (especially Luck), but this should at least be a
good enough guide to show the progression of Cloud's stats.

So, just looking at one character, we can see how stats are earned as level
rises: HP and MP, for example, both start and end rather slow, but they
increase by large amounts around L40-60.  Luck, on the other hand, jumps up
quickly until it hits the baseline, which only changes by a small amount
every ten levels or so.  Dex is similar: it grows relatively fast until you
hit around L60, at which point it slows down to a crawl and doesn't increase
by too much more by the time you reach L99.


Let's summarize, shall we?

When you gain a level, your HP, MP and primary Stats are all increased by a
random amount.  HP and MP are increased by a percentage of the Gradient for
that level bracket, while your primary Stats are increased between 0 and 3
points.  How much they increase randomly by is determined by how close the
stat was to the Baseline for that character, for that stat, for that level.
If a stat is far below the Baseline, they will often get the best increase
available for their level.  If a stat is above the Baseline, they may
instead get the lowest increase available.  With both this and the limited
amount of levels available, there is a distinct limit in how high each stat
can raise for each character.

But enough about chracter levels.  Let's move on.

2. MATERIA
----------
The first five subsections of this section are devoted to going over each
Materia in turn.  For Magic, Summon and Command, this will just be a standard
Materia list; the actual mechanics of each of the spells and commands are in
the last four subsections, starting from 2.6: Magic Spells.  Independent and
Support Materia will be covered in more detail in their own sections though.

Stars are gained by having an enemy use one of the 24 Enemy Skills in FF7
against you.  You must win the battle to keep the Enemy Skill on the Materia

If a character has two Enemy Skill Materia on them, they can only learn a new
Enemy Skill if *both* materia do not have that skill

Some Enemy Skills must be forced out of the enemy by Manipulating them

 4   80% chance of counter with paired Command           60000
 5   100% chance of counter with paired Command          100000

Can be paired with:
  Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow, Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  With the exception of Master Command, you will counter once with all the
    abilities you are considered to know that are also on the linked Materia.
    While this seems straightforward for most of them, it is especially
    important with the Throw and Steal Materia.
  Your known ability from any given Throw or Steal Materia will be the one
    highlighted on the materia.  You will be unable to counter with the other
    darkened ability *UNLESS* you have another source for that particular
    ability.  If you have a source for both abilities on the Materia, then
    you will counter with *BOTH*, the higher level ability being used
    immediately after the lower level ability.
  As an example, Counter+Steal L2 (granting Mug) would counter with the Mug
    ability.  However, if you also added a Steal L1 Materia to the character
    so that they theoretically know Steal *AND* Mug at the same time, then
    you will counter *TWICE* when attacked - first with Steal, then with Mug
    - while only needing a single Counter Materia.  However, this will take
    up two of the eight maximum counter effects you may have on a single
    character.
  When linked to Master Command, one of the commands out of Steal, Sense,
    Throw, Morph, D. blow, Manip and Mine will be picked at random to be
    used for a single counter attack.  Coin will never be used as a counter
    from a Master Command linkup, even though Master Command counts as giving
    you Coin, and not Throw.
  Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all
    share the same command space, and there are only room for 8 such attacks.
    Only the first eight Counter Effects placed chronologically onto a
    character will be used.
  Support abilities (that naturally target party members) will be used on the
    Countering player or the player's group if the ability is naturally area.
    Attack abilities will be used on the enemy that triggered the counter.

 5   100% chance of counter with paired Magic            300000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia
Notes:
  When linked to normal Magic Materia, the ability countered with will be the
    highest level ability that the current level of the linked Materia can
    bestow.  Linking to normal Summon Materia will simply counter with the
    appropriate summon.
  When linked to Master Magic, any of the 54 possible spells will be picked
    at random to be used to counter attack.
  When linked to Master Summon, any of the 16 possible summons will be picked
    at random to be used to counter attack.
  Support abilities (that naturally target party members) will be used on the
    Countering player or the player's group if the ability is naturally area.
    Attack abilities will be used on the enemy that triggered the counter.
  Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all

 4   40% MP Increase, 40% Damage Increase                60000
 5   50% MP Increase, 50% Damage Increase                120000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia
Notes:
  MP Cost = [MP Cost * (10 + MP Turbo Lv) / 10)] + 1
  If (MP Cost > 255) then: MP Cost = 255
  Even if the MP Cost is 255, the Magic Damage Increase will still be the
    full amount the Materia should give.
  Damage Increase is only applied to spells that use the Physical, Magical
    and Cure Formulas.  Spells like Demi will not be affected, but will still
    suffer from the MP Cost Increase.
  Status spells that do not have an automatic 100% chance to hit are also
    affected by MP Turbo, and are multiplied by the same formula damage is
    increased by.
  Multiple MP Turbo Materia can stack on the same spells up to the maximum of
    50% increase - the strength of a single L5 MP Turbo.  MP Turbo Materia
    only gives its effect to abilities that the linked materia can give at
    its *current* level.

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  HP Absorb will restore [Damage / 10] HP when the ability it is enhancing is
    used.  If the ability healed its target, then HP Absorb will hurt you
    instead.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to the highlighted ability on the materia.  The darkened ability
    will only be allowed to get the effect if you have *another* source for
    that particular ability equipped.  For example, if you have Throw L2
    (which grants Coin), then you would get HP Absorb applied to Coin only
    and not Throw, unless you *also* added a Throw L1 Materia to the
    character (which grants Throw only).
  When linked with Master Command, the Support Materia will apply its effect
    to *ALL* commands you currently have equipped, with the exception of
    Limit, Magic, W-Magic, Summon, W-Sum. and E.Skill.  Note that Throw is
    exempt unless you have another source for the Throw ability (since Master
    Command doesn't support Throw as a separate ability), but that Attack,
    Item, W-Item and all other additional commands are all able to gain the
    effects of the Support Materia.

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  MP Absorb will restore [Damage / 100] MP when the ability it is enhancing
    is used.  If the ability healed its target, then MP Absorb will hurt you
    instead.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its

 4   Use paired Magic with 4x-M four times per battle    120000
 5   Use paired Magic with 4x-M five times per battle    200000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia except Knights of Round
Notes:
  Any valid spell used with Quadra Magic will pick a random target out of the
    party chosen, and attempt to unleash all four castings against that
    target.  If the target dies during the castings, all unused castings are
    lost.
  Spells that are naturally area will simply hit the chosen party four times.
  Each casting will automatically have its damage cut in half; this includes
    HP% and Max HP%-based attacks like Demi and FullCure.  MP Cost will be as
    if only a single spell had been cast.
  Status effects without a 100% chance of hitting will also have their chance
    to hit cut in half.
  Quadra Magic will work with all abilities on the listed Materia above, with
    the exception of Escape and Knights of Round.
  Attaching multiple Quadra Magic to the same Materia will cause the spell to
    hit an extra time per Materia.  For example, having three Quadra Magics
    attached to three Earths would cause Quake to cast 6 times when used.
    This can be done up to a maximum of 8 times if you use five or more
    instances of Quadra Magic.
  In the event that the first spell is Reflected, the rest of the Quadra
    Magic hits will hit the target the spell was successfully reflected to,
    without needing to reflect again.

  Final Attack allows the use of the chosen ability as a counter attack
    against an attack that knocks out the character.  The standard rules for
    counter attacks still apply however
  Final Attacks will hit either the enemy or allies, depending on the default
    target for the ability.  In the case of abilities that target enemies by
    default, a random group or single enemy will be chosen.  All supportive
    spells will be targetted on the character using the Final Attack (or that
    character's group if area)
  Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all
    share the same command space, and there are only room for 8 such attacks.

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  Added Cut causes the Attack Command to be used on the same target as the
    affected ability immediately after its execution.
  If the ability was an area effect, a random target within the targetted
    group will be used.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to the highlighted ability on the materia.  The darkened ability
    will only be allowed to get the effect if you have *another* source for
    that particular ability equipped.  For example, if you have Throw L2
    (which grants Coin), then you would get Added Cut applied to Coin only
    and not Throw, unless you *also* added a Throw L1 Materia to the
    character (which grants Throw only).
  When linked with Master Command, the Support Materia will apply its effect
    to *ALL* commands you currently have equipped, with the exception of
    Limit, Magic, W-Magic, Summon, W-Sum. and E.Skill.  Note that Throw is
    exempt unless you have another source for the Throw ability (since Master

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  Will use the standard Steal effect (as seen in the Enemy Mechanics Guide
    and in summarised form on the Steal and Mug Command below) on all targets
    that are successfully hit by the linked ability.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to the highlighted ability on the materia.  The darkened ability
    will only be allowed to get the effect if you have *another* source for
    that particular ability equipped.  For example, if you have Throw L2
    (which grants Coin), then you would get Steal As Well applied to Coin
    only and not Throw, unless you *also* added a Throw L1 Materia to the
    character (which grants Throw only).
  When linked with Master Command, the Support Materia will apply its effect
    to *ALL* commands you currently have equipped, with the exception of
    Limit, Magic, W-Magic, Summon, W-Sum. and E.Skill.  Note that Throw is
    exempt unless you have another source for the Throw ability (since Master
    Command doesn't support Throw as a separate ability), but that Attack,
    Item, W-Item and all other additional commands are all able to gain the
    effects of the Support Materia.

 4   80% chance of protecting allies from attacks        25000
 5   100% chance of protecting allies from attacks       40000

Notes:
  Cover Materia stacks additively, with no coded maximum.  Overflow occurs
    at every 256%, reducing percentage back to 0.  100% is all that's
    necessary to defend against every defendable attack.
  The rules for Cover are as follows:
    * You cannot Cover someone against your own attack
    * You cannot Cover yourself
    * The attack must be Physical and have a Power stat
    * The attack must not be Curing, Inflicting or Toggling the Frog Status
    * The attack must only be hitting one Target
    * The character with the Cover Materia must not be under any of the
        following Statuses:  Death, Sleep, Confusion, Stop, Frog, Small,
                             Petrify, Berserk, Paralysed, Darkness or
                             Imprisoned
    * Enemy attacks that use visible projectile animations (attacks that
        merely cause hit graphics do not count) are also impossible
        to Cover - these abilities are listed in Enemy Mechanics as
        'Can't Cover'
  If all rules are passed and the Cover percentage check passes, then a
    random character out of those who pass all the checks is chosen to cover
    the target.
  Any PAt%-based ability targetting a character that is Covering another will
    have its base Hit% increased to 255%.
  Perhaps the strangest ability that is covered by the above rules is Elixir.
    Be careful when giving Elixirs to party members while one of them has the
    Cover Materia equipped.

Notes:
  The use of this Materia also swaps the HP and MP maximums and damage caps
    for abilities that target that character.  Any ability targetting a
    character with the HP<->MP Materia equipped cannot do more than 999 HP
    damage and 9999 MP damage

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. LIMIT BREAKS
---------------

This section, as you can guess, is devoted to the Limit Breaks in Final
Fantasy 7.  Each of the nine characters in the game have their own unique
Limit Breaks.

---  --------------
3.1  Earning Limits
---  --------------
Limit Breaks are divided up into Levels.  You select which Limit Level you
wish to use, and whenever your Limit Bar fills up, you can use any Limit you
have in that Level, but no other.  However, before you can use a Limit Break
of any Level, you must earn it.

The following chart shows the bare minimum you must achieve to gain each
Limit Break.  The chart headers are as follows.

L1-2:
  The second Limit Break of the first Limit Level requires that your L1-1
Break be used a certain number of times before you can gain your L1-2 Break.
The number in this column is the number of times you have to use your L1-1
Break.

L2-1:
  The number in this column indicates how many enemies the character must
personally defeat before they gain the use of their L2-1 Break.  Note that
you can gain your L2-1 Break before your L1-2 one.

L2-2:
  You must use your L2-1 Break so many times before you can gain your L2-2
Break.  This column indicates exactly how many times.

L3-1:
  The number in this column indicates how many enemies the character must
have killed in the entire game (this column includes the number killed to
gain their L2-1 Break), to gain their L3-1 Break.  Note that you can gain
your L3-1 Break before either your L1-2 or your L2-2 Breaks.

L3-2:
  The final column indicates how many times you must use your L3-1 Break
before you can gain your L3-2 Break.


Note that Vincent only has one Break per Level, and Cait Sith has only two
Limit Breaks: his L1-1 and his L2-1.  Also note that to score a use of a
Limit Break, or a kill, you must win the battle.  If you run away, Limit
Break usage and kills during that battle will not be counted.  The
requirements for each character are as follows:

                L1-2       L2-1       L2-1       L3-1       L3-2
Cloud             8        120          7        320          6
Barret            9         80          8        160          6
Tifa              9         96          7        192          6
Aeris             8         80          6        160          5
Red XIII          8         72          7        144          6
Yuffie            8         64          7        128          6
Cait Sith         -         40          -          -          -
Vincent           -         40          -         96          -
Cid               7         60          6        136          5


*** WARNING: These values were gained through looking at FF7's memory banks
and using debug values.  I will not tolerate e-mails complaining that these
values are inaccurate: they aren't.  However, even respected testers have
managed to get different results when actually counting the number of kills
they've done.  The cause for this is currently unknown, but random variation
in the kills required is considered unlikely.  This is also not a difference
between PC and PSX versions, since both use the same table ***


In addition to the requirements above, you cannot choose to use a certain
Limit Level until you have at least one Limit Break in that Level.


---  -------------
3.2  The Limit Bar
---  -------------
The Limit Bar dictates when you can use a certain Limit Break.  Depending on
your Status Attributes, and which Limit Level you have chosen to build, it
will grow quickly or slowly based on the damage you take.

A character's Limit Bar is measured in Units.  Once a Limit Bar contains 255
Units, the Limit Bar is full, and the character may use their Limit Break.

The conversion rate between damage points and Limit Bar Units is as
follows:

   Units gained = [[300 * HP Lost / Max HP] * 256 * Status Factor / LNum]



In the above formula, Status Factor is equal to 2.0 while in 'Fury' Status,
0.5 in 'Sadness' Status, and 1.0 otherwise.

LNum, on the other hand, is a special number that varies for each character
at each Limit Level.  The following table shows the LNum value for all nine
characters at each of their Limit Levels.

                   Level 1       Level 2       Level 3       Level 4
     Cloud           140           324           435           506
     Barret          129           240           374           450
     Tifa            120           334           509           566
     Aeris           200           284           322           436
     Red XIII        195           300           389           486
     Yuffie          200           300           400           480
     Cait Sith       160           180          9590 *       12760 *
     Vincent         202           244           319           426
     Cid             200           280           380           480

 * Cait Sith does not have either a L3 or L4 Limit Break - these numbers
   are still in the data, however.


Obviously, the higher the number, the larger the percentage of your Max HP
you must lose before you can fill the Limit Bar.  With the numbers above, it
is possible to work out the rough percentage of HP that must be lost:

                   Level 1       Level 2       Level 3       Level 4
     Cloud           46.5%        107.6%        144.4%        168.0%
     Barret          42.8%         79.7%        124.2%        149.4%
     Tifa            39.8%        110.9%        169.0%        187.9%
     Aeris           66.4%         94.3%        106.9%        144.8%
     Red XIII        64.7%         99.6%        129.2%        161.4%
     Yuffie          66.4%         99.6%        132.8%        159.3%
     Cait Sith       53.1%         59.8%         ----          ----
     Vincent         67.1%         81.0%        105.9%        141.4%
     Cid             66.4%         93.0%        126.2%        159.3%


In addition to that, the Status Attribute 'Fury' will double your Limit Bar
growth, while the Status Attribute 'Sadness' will halve it.  For example,
trying to max out Cloud's Limit Bar at Level 4 with 'Fury' would amount to a
loss of 84.0% of your total HP, instead of the normal 168.0%.

You should note that any Limit Bar Units you gain are rounded down at two
occasions.  First, it uses 1/300 units of your Max HP to work out how much
damage was done to you, Limit-wise, and then it converts those units into
Limit Bar Units, which can cause even more rounding down.  Thus, you will
often note that you have to lose more than the listed amount of HP above.
For instance, when maxing out a L4 Limit Bar with Fury status with 9999 Max
HP, any attack that hits you for 33 or less HP will cause you to gain 0
Units, since 33 is less than 1/300th of 9999.  In addition, when maxing out
a L4 Limit Bar with Sadness status with 9999 Max HP, you must be hit for 134
or more HP to gain even a single Limit Bar 'Unit'.


An interesting comparison is to order the characters and their Limit Levels
by the amount of HP they must lose:

         Approx Base HP Loss     Character's Limit
                187.9%         **** Lv 4 - Tifa
                169.0%          *** Lv 3 - Tifa
                168.0%         **** Lv 4 - Cloud
                161.4%         **** Lv 4 - Red XIII
                159.3%         **** Lv 4 - Yuffie
                159.3%         **** Lv 4 - Cid
                149.4%         **** Lv 4 - Barret
                144.8%         **** Lv 4 - Aeris
                144.4%          *** Lv 3 - Cloud
                141.4%         **** Lv 4 - Vincent
                132.8%          *** Lv 3 - Yuffie
                129.2%          *** Lv 3 - Red XIII
                126.2%          *** Lv 3 - Cid
                124.2%          *** Lv 3 - Barret
                110.9%           ** Lv 2 - Tifa
                107.6%           ** Lv 2 - Cloud
                106.9%          *** Lv 3 - Aeris
                105.9%          *** Lv 3 - Vincent
                 99.6%           ** Lv 2 - Red XIII
                 99.6%           ** Lv 2 - Yuffie
                 94.3%           ** Lv 2 - Aeris
                 93.0%           ** Lv 2 - Cid
                 81.0%           ** Lv 2 - Vincent
                 79.7%           ** Lv 2 - Barret
                 67.1%            * Lv 1 - Vincent
                 66.4%            * Lv 1 - Aeris
                 66.4%            * Lv 1 - Yuffie
                 66.4%            * Lv 1 - Cid
                 64.7%            * Lv 1 - Red XIII
                 59.8%           ** Lv 2 - Cait Sith
                 53.1%            * Lv 1 - Cait Sith
                 46.5%            * Lv 1 - Cloud
                 42.8%            * Lv 1 - Barret
                 39.8%            * Lv 1 - Tifa


Or, ordered by level first and then HP% (highest first):

  Lvl  Character List
   4    Tifa, Cloud, Red XIII, Yuffie/Cid, Barret, Aeris, Vincent
   3    Tifa, Cloud, Yuffie, Red XIII, Cid, Barret, Aeris, Vincent
   2    Tifa, Cloud, Red XIII/Yuffie, Aeris, Cid, Vincent, Barret, Cait Sith
   1    Vincent, Aeris/Yuffie/Cid, Red XIII, Cait Sith, Cloud, Barret, Tifa


So Tifa tends to require the highest amount of HP% lost, while Vincent tends
to require the lowest - the main exception being at Limit Level 1, where
they're reversed.  Other conclusions can be drawn from this, and it is
instructive to compare both these tables to the power of the individual
abilities a character gains at these levels below.


One final note: Limit Bar Units are only accumulated when damage is done to a
character by an enemy.  Damage inflicted by allies will not increase Limit
Bars.

           but deals damage.  Because of the order this is done in, some
           enemies can be killed with this that would not otherwise be

3.3.3 Tifa's Limit Breaks
----- --------------------
Note that using one of Tifa's Limit Breaks will also automatically use all of
her Limit Breaks that are lower in level than the one used.  Also, each Break
will have one of three statuses:
   Miss: Tifa will not perform the Limit Break
    Hit: Tifa will use the Limit Break for normal damage (no Criticals)
  YEAH!: Tifa will use the Limit Break and do Critical Damage

Although each of Tifa's Limit Breaks have a Target of 1 Op, these targets
will all be picked randomly.

3.3.5 Red XIII's Limit Breaks

  Notes: Lunatic High adds 50% to Red XIII's Df% Mod
         This Modifier cannot exceed 100%
         BUG: Red XIII gains +50% Df% Mod *per target* it hits.  For example,
           if two allies (including Red XIII) are alive and Lunatic High is
           used, Red XIII will gain +100% Df% Mod total (2 * 50%)
         Other Party Members do not earn a bonus to their Df% Mod; their
           bonus is instead given to Red XIII as explained above due to
           the bug

  Notes: The amount absorbed is 100% of the damage dealt added to both
           Red XIII's HP and MP.  However, the HP gain is capped at the
           enemy's current HP before the attack, and both HP *and* MP gains
           are capped at the enemy's current MP (which is not damaged by use
           of Blood Fang)
         Red XIII will fail to absorb anything from enemies with 0 MP,
           although the attack will still deal damage to the enemy's HP

3.3.7 Cait Sith's Limit Breaks
----- ------------------------
Cait Sith only has two Limit Levels, and their effects are quite complicaed,
so we will deal with them one at a time.


3.3.7.1 Dice
------- ----
Dice
  Physical LR Attack
  Formula: Custom
  Pwr: Dice Sum * Highest Repeat * 100
  PAt%: 255
  Tar: 1 Op
  Elm: Non-Element
  Attr: Two to six dice are thrown depending on Cait Sith's Level:
                L 1-29:   2 Dice             L50-59:   5 Dice
                L30-39:   3 Dice             L60+  :   6 Dice
                L40-49:   4 Dice
        The Sum of the dice dictates the basic damage, while the highest
          number of repeats dictates the multiplier.  For example, 6 dice
          thrown with the numbers 4, 1, 1, 5, 4, 4 would have a Sum of 19
          (4+1+1+5+4+4 = 19) and a Highest Repeat of 3 (there are three 4s,
          two 1s and one 5) giving a total damage of 5700
  Notes: Damage with 2 Dice is  300-2400, average of  816.67
            ... with 3 Dice is  600-5400, average of 1545.83
            ... with 4 Dice is 1000-9600, average of 2553.70
            ... with 5 Dice is 1500-9999, average of 3743.31
            ... with 6 Dice is 2100-9999, average of 5025.76



3.3.7.2 Slots
------- -----
Similar to Tifa, Cait Sith gets a slot machine menu when he chooses this
limit.  There are 3 reels, and each reel will have one or more of the
following symbols:

   *CaitS*:    Part of Cait Sith (the cat)'s face
   ==BAR==:    Standard BAR you see on your classic slot machine
   Crown:      A three-pointed regal crown
   Heart:      A pink heart
   Star:       A gold star
   Moogle:     A picture of the oversized Moogle that Cait Sith rides

The reels spin upwards continually, and are laid out as follows:

     +=========+=========+=========+
     | REEL  1 | REEL  2 | REEL  3 |
     +=========+=========+=========+  *CaitS* *CaitS* *CaitS* = Game Over
     |  Crown  | ==BAR== |  Crown  |  
     | Moogle  |  Crown  |  Star   |  *CaitS* *CaitS* ==BAR== = Death Joker
     |  Star   |  Star   |  Heart  |  
     |  Heart  | *CaitS* |  Crown  |  ==BAR== ==BAR== ==BAR== = Summon
     | ==BAR== |  Crown  | ==BAR== |  
     |  Crown  | ==BAR== |  Star   |   Crown   Crown   Crown  = Toy Soldier
     |  Star   |  Heart  | *CaitS* |  
     | *CaitS* | Moogle  | Moogle  |   Heart   Heart   Heart  = Lucky Girl
     | ==BAR== |  Star   |  Crown  |  
     |  Heart  | *CaitS* | ==BAR== |   Star    Star    Star   = Mog Dance
     | Moogle  |  Crown  |  Heart  |  
     |  Crown  | ==BAR== |  Crown  |  Moogle  Moogle  Moogle  = Transform
     |  Star   | Moogle  |  Star   |  
     | *CaitS* |  Star   | ==BAR== |
     | Moogle  |  Crown  |  Crown  |  ALL OTHER COMBINATIONS  = Toy Box
     | ==BAR== |  Heart  | Moogle  |
     +=========+=========+=========+


When you hit the Confirm button, the next reel in the series will stop
spinning and halt on one of the symbols.  You must line up three symbols in
one of the eight combinations given above next to the reel list in order to
get the effect.  Note that any failed combination is automatically Toy Box,
the simplest effect Slots has.

The speed of the reel is such that it takes 8 frames for the next symbol to
appear.  To stop the reel on a particular symbol, you must hit the button
*before* the symbol aligns in the center - otherwise, it will spin on to the
next one.

While the 1st Reel plays fair and stops exactly where you want it to, the
2nd and 3rd Reels have special rules that may stop them on a later symbol.
Sometimes this is helpful.  Sometimes... it is not.

Once you try to stop the 2nd Reel, various things are checked.  Most
importantly, we have what we'll happily call Slots's Evil Flag.  The Evil
Flag is turned on when we first use the Limit Break - the Slots automatically
try to work against us.  It won't do anything to start with - as stated, the
1st Reel plays completely fair.  But it can play havoc with the 2nd and 3rd
Reels.

However, once the 1st Reel has been stopped, the Evil Flag can be turned off
under various circumstances, all linked to when you're pressing the button to
stop the next reel and what symbol the 1st Reel has.  The number of seconds
the game has been played is used for this - if you recall, this is the timer
listed in the bottom right corner of the Menu screen.  We will use that
number here.

The Evil Flag is turned off depending on the following:

  * If the 1st Reel has the Cait Sith symbol, then the Evil Flag is turned
    off if, when you try to stop the 2nd or 3rd Reel, the number of seconds
    the game has been played for is divisible by 64.  Otherwise, the Evil
    Flag is turned on.

  * If the 1st Reel has the Heart symbol, then the Evil Flag is turned off
    only if when you tried to stop the reel, the number of seconds the game
    has been played for is divisible by 4.  Otherwise, the flag is left on.
    
  * If the 1st Reel has the BAR or Moogle symbols, then the Evil Flag is set
    to off if you try to stop the reel and the number of seconds the game has
    been played for is divisible by 2.  Otherwise, the flag is kept on.

  * If the 1st Reel has the Crown or Star symbols, then the Evil Flag is
    always turned off when you press the Confirm button to stop the 2nd or
    3rd reels.

Note that this test is done twice - once when you stop the 2nd Reel, and
again when you try to stop the 3rd Reel.  So even if you have the Evil Flag
off for stopping the 2nd Reel (giving you a better chance to line up a run of
2), it may come back on for the 3rd if you press the button at the wrong
time.  The effects of the Evil Flag on both Reels are as follows.


With the Evil Flag on, the following effects occur:

  * The 2nd Reel will stop immediately where you ask it to.  The Slot Machine
    will not attempt to help you line up any symbols.

  * The 3rd Reel will *DELIBERATELY* move onto the next symbol if the current
    symbol would give you a line of three identical symbols.  As such, it is
    impossible to get a line of three if the Evil Flag is on.


With the Evil Flag off, things are a lot easier:

  * The 2nd Reel will move on for up to 4 extra spaces, only stopping when
    an identical symbol to the 1st Reel is found or it has moved the full 4
    spaces.

  * The 3rd Reel will move on for up to 4 extra spaces in an attempt to find
    a symbol identical to the one shown on the 2nd Reel.


Since Slots is based on the timer, you can attempt to improve your chances
of getting a particular result (especially Game Over) by keeping track of the
timer yourself.  In the PC version, however, this is not an easy task,
considering how poor the actual timer is compared to real seconds and
minutes.  Still, the knowledge has to be worth something.

Note that even with the Evil Flag on *OR* off, you can still stop the current
reel *DEAD* if you hit the button at exactly the right time.  That means
stopping it such that the reel is already lined up.  This requires timing
that is extremely accurate however, and is not to be counted on.  In
addition, it hinders more often than it helps (by preventing the reel from
helping you when the Evil Flag is actually off).

Also, if you stop all three reels quick enough, you can often confuse the
help the reels try to give you, since the 1st and 2nd Reels may still be
moving and displaying a different symbol than the one they'll eventually
stop on.


As we brushed over previously, the combination of symbols you get gives you
one of eight possible effects.  We will now go over those in turn.



Game Over
  Effect of [*CaitS* *CaitS* *CaitS*]
  Magical Change Status
  MAt%: 255
  Tar: All Op (NS)
  Elm: Non-Element
  Attr: 100%  Inflict 'Death'
        Ignores Status Immunity and Elemental Resistance
          (Will not ignore Physical or Magical Immunity)
  Notes: The Evil Flag is only turned off once every 64 seconds for this
           effect

Death Joker
  Effect of [*CaitS* *CaitS* ==BAR==]
  Magical Change Status
  MAt%: 255
  Tar: All Al (NS)
  Elm: Non-Element
  Attr: 100%  Inflict 'Death'
        Ignores Status Immunity and Elemental Resistance
          (Will not ignore Physical or Magical Immunity)
  Notes: The Evil Flag will never give you this effect deliberately - if you
           get this effect, it's because you stopped on it yourself

Summon
  Effect of [==BAR== ==BAR== ==BAR==]
  Cait Sith will use a random Summon, using the following formula:
     ID   = Rnd(1..10) + Rnd(1..10) + Rnd(1..10) + Rnd(1..10)
     ID   = ID + [Cait Sith's Level / 21]
     ID   = [ID / 2] - 3
  ID is then capped between 1 and 16 inclusive.  The ID generated is the
    Summon that is used:
           1: Choco/Mog                   9: Kujata
           2: Shiva                      10: Alexander
           3: Ifrit                      11: Phoenix
           4: Ramuh                      12: Neo Bahamut
           5: Titan                      13: Hades
           6: Odin                       14: Typhon
           7: Leviathan                  15: Bahamut Zero
           8: Bahamut                    16: Knights of Round
  Cait Sith does not have to pay an MP Cost to use any of these through
    Slots, and it also will not consume any uses of your Summons.  However,
    similarly, it will not take advantage of any Materia linkup
  The name of the Summon will be used instead of the usual Attack Name,
    except in the case of Fat-Chocobo and Gunge Lance
  For the record, this gives you a 2.1% chance of Knights of Round when Cait
    is at L84 or greater, while Alexander will be used most often at that
    level.  At L20 and below, the most common Summon will be Bahamut instead
  Notes: The Evil Flag is only turned off once every 2 seconds for this
           effect

  Notes: The Evil Flag is always off for this effect

Transform
  Effect of [Moogle  Moogle  Moogle ]
  Magical Misc Ability
  MAt%: 255
  Tar: All Al
  Notes: Will fail if Cait Sith is alone in the battle
         When used, Cait Sith's allies will vanish and Cait Sith himself will
           grow to a gigantic size
         While in this state, Cait Sith can use all the commands he could
           before, but with the following differences:
       * Cait Sith may not use the Limit Command
       * Cait Sith's eight battle stats - Att, Def, Df%, MAt, MDf, MD%, Dex
           and Lck - now have a base value equal to the average value of the
           entire party.  Bonuses from Hero Drinks and the like do not count
           towards this average value, and for Df%, only the value of armor
           worn is used - the Dex bonus is not added together
       * Cait Sith then has these stats adjusted up or down depending on the
           stat itself:
              Att = Att + [100% * Att]       Def = Def + [ 20% * Def]
              MAt = MAt + [ 20% * MAt]       MDf = MDf + [ 20% * MDf]
              Df% = Df% - [ 20% * Df%]       MD% = MD% - [ 50% * MD%]

           These values are all capped at 255 maximum
       * HP, Max HP, MP and Max MP are totalled up, and Cait Sith gets the
           sum of the entire party's health and mana stats.  They are capped
           at 9999 HP and 999 MP respectively (or the reverse if you have the
           HP<->MP Materia equipped)
       * All of Cait Sith's original bonuses (including things like Hero
           Drinks) are left untouched, and take advantage of the new values
       * At the end of battle, all three party members will have their HP
           reset to 1/3rd of Cait Sith's current HP, and their MP reset to
           1/3rd of Cait Sith's current MP
  Notes: The Evil Flag is only turned off once every 2 seconds for this
           effect

Toy Box
  Effect of Any Other Combination
  Physical LR Attack
  Formula: Physical
  Pwr: See Notes
  PAt%: 255
  Tar: 1 Op
  Elm: Non-Element
  Notes: Toy Box uses one of 7 random animations depending on how powerful
           the effect is - this effect is picked entirely at random with an
           equal chance of each:
         2x     Base: A boulder falls and splits open on top of the enemy
         2 1/2x Base: Icicles fall and spear through the enemy
         3x     Base: A giant lead weight crushes the enemy
         3 1/2x Base: A massive hammer smashes into the enemy
         4x     Base: A Fat Chocobo flattens the enemy
         4 1/2x Base: A Hell House falls onto the enemy from above
         5x     Base: Six comets slam into the battlefield


3.3.8 Vincent's Limit Breaks
----- ----------------------
Using one of Vincent's Limit Breaks will heal him of Berserk, Frog and
Confusion statuses; this is just a sanity check however, since he can't use
his Limit Break normally under any of those conditions.  He will, however,
gain immunities to those three statuses while he is under the effect.

In addition, Vincent will gain bonuses (or in one case, penalties) to his
various Stat Modifiers, as well as a Max HP bonus with his first two limits.
These bonuses last until the end of battle or until Vincent is KOed (which
ends the Limit Break in any case).  On top of that, his HP will be healed to
full.

Note that no Stat Modifier can exceed 100% or -100%.  They are additive with
your current Modifiers however, so Dragon Force and Hero Drinks will stack
with them up to the 100% limit.

Once transformed, Vincent will randomly use one of the two attacks available
to him, each of which are unique to the form he has chosen.  He always has a
30% chance of using his Magic attack and a subsequent 70% chance of using his
Physical attack.

                                   order this is done in, some enemies can be

           HP before the attack, and both HP *and* MP gains are capped at the
           enemy's current MP (which is not damaged by use of Dragon)
         Cid will fail to absorb anything from enemies with 0 MP, although
           the attack will still deal damage to the enemy's HP

4.1  Weapons

Most of the data here is reasonably straightforward and self-explanatory.
However, note that each weapon has its own added element (one of the five
hidden physical elements, although Shout can't be found on a weapon).  Also
be aware of the Special Notes section of certain weapons; some will have
additional factors that are included in damage.  Finally, certain weapons
increase your chance of a Critical Hit; this is shown in the Special Notes
section as a bonus to Critical Hit Rate.  The higher the bonus, the higher
the chance of a critical hit.  It's worthwhile to note that the Masamune
(+255% Critical Hit Rate) can never fail to deliver a critical.

Also, please note that the Power value used in the Before Damage Effects of
the Ultimate Weapons is referring to the integer value that FF7 stores - a
Power of 16 is a standard 1x Base Physical attack, while a Power of 2 would
be the starting power of an attack using Morph.

  Before Damage Effect
    Power = [Average Level of all Enemies Targetted by Attack]
  Because the Power of the Ability you use is completely overwritten by
    Conformer's Effect, Morph will not reduce damage dealt at all
  If used against only allies, Power will be 0, since only enemies are
    checked in the equation.  In this instance, an attack with the Conformer
    will be a standard physical hit, but no damage will be caused or
    displayed.  Added Effect statuses will still be applied however, and as
    a physical hit, the attack can remove Confusion and Sleep as normal

Name: Sneak Glove
Effects: Raise Chance of Steal/Mug
         This is done by adjusting your character's Lvl during an attempt to
           steal an item: if you are less than 60 levels greater than your
           target, then the Sneak Glove will essentially set your Lvl
           (*ONLY* for Stealing) to Target's Lvl + 60 as a minimum
         Note that this conditional level increase for Steal Mechanics can
           break the L99 barrier due to the way Steal Rate is calculated

Name: HypnoCrown
Effects: Raise Chance of Manipulate
         This is done by removing the chance that the enemy will evade the
           Manipulate.  Situations and attributes that grant the enemy
           immunity to the attack are not ignored, however

A-1  Maximal HP/MP Level Up Paths
---  ----------------------------
So, you want to reach the maximum natural HP and MP available in the game,
yes?  The other stats are simple, since even if you don't get the natural
maximum, you can always make up the difference with Sources.  But HP and MP?
Far more difficult.

First off, let's explain the Max Safety Level table that we're about to see.
This is the maximum level you can get to while *completely* ignoring HP and
MP gains.  No matter what your natural HP and MP, if you're below or equal to
the Max Safety Level, then you still have a chance to get the maximum in that
stat.  So here's the list of the maximum safe levels for each character.


         Cloud       Max Safety Lvl:  77 (HP), 62 (MP), 62 (Both)
         Barret      Max Safety Lvl:  77 (HP), 51 (MP), 51 (Both)
         Tifa        Max Safety Lvl:  77 (HP), 51 (MP), 51 (Both)
         Aeris       Max Safety Lvl:  78 (HP), 50 (MP), 50 (Both)
         Red XIII    Max Safety Lvl:  60 (HP), 43 (MP), 43 (Both)
         Yuffie      Max Safety Lvl:  78 (HP), 51 (MP), 51 (Both)
         Cait Sith   Max Safety Lvl:  72 (HP), 51 (MP), 51 (Both)
         Vincent     Max Safety Lvl:  39 (HP), 69 (MP), 39 (Both)
         Cid         Max Safety Lvl:  45 (HP), 51 (MP), 45 (Both)



While a Safety Level is given for Both, please be advised that due to the way
FF7's RNG works, it is impossible to reach the maximum HP *and* MP on the
same character, since you cannot get both the highest HP roll and highest
MP roll at the same time.  Those interested in reaching a compromise for
maxing both can find tables for that in Absolute Steve's FAQ, among other
places.

Now.  The following tables will go over each character in turn, going over
first HP and then MP.  For each level, a list of numbers will be given.
These numbers are the *SAFE* natural HP or MP values from which you can still
achieve the maximum.

As an example, let's look at the last five levels of Barret's HP table:

   L95  9583-9634
   L96  9687-9729
   L97  9791-9824
   L98  9895-9919
   L99  9999


Now, the translation is this.  At L95, you are safe if your HP is *ANYWHERE*
between 9583 and 9634 inclusive.  At L96, you are safe if your HP is
*ANYWHERE* between 9687 and 9729 inclusive.  At L98, it's between 9895 and
9919 inclusive.  At L99... well, there's only one *maximum*, and that's 9999.

As another example, here's Cloud's safe HP values for L96:

   L96  9190, 9199, 9208-9209, 9217


This means that only 9190, 9199, 9208, 9209 and 9217 are safe.  Because
9208 and 9209 are in a series, they are expressed as such.  Any *VALID* HP
value within a series is included as a safe value.

Now, if you level up and your natural HP or MP value is *NOT* in the table,
then it is no longer possible for you to achieve the maximum value with that
character.  The reason for this is explained in the Level Up! section of this
document - sometimes, a single point of HP/MP is enough to put you above or
below a percentage of the baseline which would give you a lower growth.
Controlling this is critical to achieving max stats, hence the tables.

Finally, please remember that these are the *natural* values.  If you have
Materia equipped that raises or lowers HP or MP, then you will need to remove
them or adjust appropriately for their effect.

In any case, with all the explanations finished, let's move on to the final
tables themselves.  I hope they're useful.

NOTE: The hackers among you should be careful about series, since I express
them as all the *VALID* HP or MP values within a range.  As an example, if I
used '9500-9503' in the list for a particular level, that would mean that
9500 and 9503 are definitely safe.  However, 9501 and 9502 would only be safe
if they are *naturally possible* to get at that level.  If either is
impossible, then there is no guarantee that hacking your HP to that value at
that level would still allow you to get the maximum.  Of course, this
warning should end up only applying to a tiny handful of you, since the rest
either don't care or will be hacking their HP to 9999 and MP to 999 anyways.
